My Vue app was sending a pre-flight OPTIONS request, for which Flask didn't respond with an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, even tho I was using Flask-CORS.\n\nDid you just scrap the flask-cors library all together?\n\nYup, you don't need it once everything is coming from the same origin.\n\nOkay, thanks. I'll try to learn how Nginx works! Hopefully, I can leave this thread after it. :)\n\nIt's not hard, and you'll probably need to learn it anyway once you want to deploy your app, so you're not wasting time. Have fun! :)\n\nHey, was wondering if you could point me in the right direction with using Nginx and docker. I've followed many guides and I'm still running into CORS. This is an update on my original stack overflow post to show what I have so far:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65503432/running-into-issues-with-cors-with-flask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65503432/running-into-issues-with-cors-with-flask)\n\nTry running react on port 3000 and then in your docker-compose section for react set:\n\n    ports:\n      - 3000:3000\n\nand then in nginx config set:\n\n    proxy_pass          http://react-client:3000;\n\nI'm not sure how you configured the containers, but `3000:80` means that port `80` inside the container maps to port `3000` on the host machine. If you're not using these ports for anything but nginx, it's better to use the `expose` instruction instead of `ports`.\n\nAlso, you're now supposed to access your frontend from `localhost:80`, not `localhost:3000`.\n\nSo I tried those changes and now I get a bad gateway error :( Also, how does the proxy\\_pass portion work? so for example, proxy\\_pass [http://react-client:3000](http://react-client:3000), if we are at the root url, would the entire url change? When I mean is would the process do something similar to making a request from say localhost:5000 instead of localhost:3000?\n\nDamn, weird stuff. Check what the logs say?\n\nproxy_pass just links an nginx location with a provided app. For example:\n\n    location /login {\n        proxy_pass          http://flask-backend:5000;\n    }\n\nHere, `/login` URL would redirect to port `5000` on hostname `flask-backend`. AFAIK, docker-compose manages hostnames and by default they're the same as the container names, so hostnames should work automatically. You need the ports to match with what your docker containers expose. \n\nYou could also theoretically point this to some remote server and to the user it would still all appear as if it's coming from the same domain, and that's why it solves the CORS stuff.\n\nOn your host machine, you're accessing nginx on port `80`, and that's the only place from which nginx will handle requests and uses the appropriate proxies etc. If you're still accessing frontend via port `3000`, then it's being handled directly by React built-in development server and you will still get CORS errors because your frontend is on port 3000, and it's calling backend on port 5000. For the CORS errors to disappear everything must originate on the same hostname and port.\n\nYa, I had that previously before as well. What seemed to fix the CORS issue was creating an upstream. Here is an updated version of my config files here:\n\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65503432/running-into-issues-with-cors-with-flask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65503432/running-into-issues-with-cors-with-flask)\n\nStill not working though, unfortunately :(",

Dockerized it, used nginx as a reverse proxy, still had the issue (we were using Okta for login so removing CORS wasn\u2019t an option). \n\nThe issue was that https was a hard requirement and things simply wouldn\u2019t work without it. You can fake it with self-signed certificates, but Okta wasn\u2019t having it and we needed real certs. If you have a registered domain, you can get them for free with certbot. Nobody is going to give you certs for localhost, and even if you spin up an ec2 instance on aws (or the equivalent from whoever), you still can\u2019t get them for an aws/other cloud provider url, since those IP\u2019s change hands so frequently. \n\nWhat worked for me was to use a subdomain if a domain we already owned from Namecheap (or whoever), spin up an ec2 instance (the smallest i.e. t2.micro is fine), set an elastic IP, register it with Namecheap, fire up nginx (I also used a simple hello world flask app to be sure it was working), and use certbot to get proper certificates. Make sure you can reach your site via https (once you\u2019ve modified the nginx.conf file appropriately). \n\nOnce you have the certs, get them on your local and shut down the instance. The last thing you need to do is add a line to your /etc/hosts file, setting 127.0.0.1 to point to your subdomain. This tricks your machine into thinking it\u2019s hitting the internet and should handle the https issues. The same ngninx.conf file should work that you used on the instance. \n\nCheck that you can get to your hello world flask app via https by hitting that subdomain. If you can, you should be good to go with your actual flask + react app (which now includes nginx and is ideally dockerized)",

          "content": "When you tunnel your Flask app through ngrok, the origin of your request is effectively changed from your local Flask server to the ngrok URL. So, even if you've set up CORS to allow all origins with `origins=\"*\"`, there can still be issues if there's any inconsistency between how the front-end and back-end handle the requests.\n\nHere are some troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Check the Exact Error Message:** Make sure the error is directly related to CORS and not some other error. The browser's developer console should provide details about the CORS error, such as which header is missing or incorrect.\n\n2. **Explicitly Specify the ngrok URL in `origins`**: Instead of using the wildcard `*`, explicitly list the ngrok URL to see if it solves the issue.\n   \n   ```python\n   allowed_origins = [\"http://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok.io\"]\n   CORS(app, supports_credentials=True, origins=allowed_origins)\n   ```\n\n3. **Handle Preflight Requests**: Ensure you're correctly handling CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests. Flask-CORS should handle this for you, but if there's some other middleware or route that's intercepting those requests, they might not be handled properly.\n\n4. **Use `https` for Both Flask and ngrok**: If your Flask app is running in `https`, make sure you're also using the `https` protocol for ngrok. This ensures that the protocols match.\n\n5. **Inspect Headers**: Using tools like Postman or the browser's developer console, inspect the headers of the request and the response. Ensure the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is present and correctly set in the response.\n\n6. **Update Flask-CORS**: Ensure you're using the latest version of Flask-CORS. Sometimes bugs are fixed in newer releases.\n\n7. **Check if Other Middleware Interferes**: If you have other middlewares in your Flask app, ensure they're not interfering with Flask-CORS or modifying the headers in some way.\n\n8. **Logs and Debug**: Use Flask's debug mode or check ngrok's web interface (usually available at `http://localhost:4040`) for request logs. This can give insights into what's going wrong.\n\nIf after trying these steps you're still encountering issues, consider sharing the exact CORS error message and any related request/response headers for further assistance.\n\nHey, I  have edited the question (Edit 2) please look. I have addressed all of which I got. Is there anything else I could do? Thanks a lot!  \nAlso, setting the origins to ngrok wouldn't make sense because my backend is on ngrok not frontent :) I just want my backend on ngrok to accept frontend\n\nTeach me!!!!\n\nThe error message states that the server isn't sending the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its response. Let's break it down and find a solution:\n\n### 1. Protocol Mismatch:\nEven though you mentioned in Edit 1 that using HTTP on both Flask and ngrok still results in a CORS error, it's important to be aware that browsers consider HTTP and HTTPS as different origins. That said, the error message points out that the backend (ngrok URL) is HTTPS while the frontend is HTTP. This alone can lead to CORS issues.\n\n### 2. Flask-CORS and Wildcard with Credentials:\n\nWhen you set the origins to `\"*\"` and at the same time have `supports_credentials=True`, it can cause problems. Browsers do not allow wildcards with credentials. Instead of the wildcard, you need to specify the actual origin:\n\n```python\nCORS(app, supports_credentials=True, origins=[\"http://192.168.1.140:5173\"])\n```\n\n### 3. Multiple Origins:\n\nIf you have multiple origins, dynamically set the origin based on the request:\n\n```python\ndef cors_origin(response):\n    request_origin = request.headers.get('Origin')\n    valid_origins = [\"http://192.168.1.140:5173\", \"http://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok.io\"]\n    if request_origin in valid_origins:\n        response.headers.add(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", request_origin)\n    return response\n\napp.after_request(cors_origin)\n```\n\n### 4. Handling Preflight Requests:\n\nThe error message indicates a problem with the preflight `OPTIONS` request. Make sure that the server responds correctly to the `OPTIONS` request. You might need to handle it manually:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/your-endpoint', methods=['OPTIONS'])\ndef options():\n    response = flask.make_response()\n    response.headers.add(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"http://192.168.1.140:5173\")\n    response.headers.add(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", \"GET, POST, OPTIONS\")\n    response.headers.add(\"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\", \"Content-Type, Authorization\")\n    response.headers.add(\"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\", \"true\")\n    return response\n```\n\n### 5. Ngrok Headers:\n\nNgrok may be modifying headers or not passing them along as expected. You can test this by manually proxying requests (using tools like Postman) and examining headers at each stage to see if they're getting stripped or altered.\n\n### 6. Other Flask Middlewares:\n\nIf there are other middlewares in your Flask app, ensure they aren't running after Flask-CORS and modifying the headers, which can nullify the CORS headers.\n\n### 7. Debugging:\n\nUse logging in Flask to log all incoming headers and the response headers. This will provide insights on what headers are received and what's sent back.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe key is to ensure your server is responding with the proper CORS headers for both preflight and actual requests. Pay special attention to the wildcard and credentials issue. If your app is still showing CORS errors after all these changes, consider setting up a simpler version of your app without any additional middlewares to narrow down the issue.",

Manually in the get request, through middleware using something like flask-CORs or using a reverse proxy, http load balancer, or through some CDNs like cloud flare.

On the same machine, I can access the server and get the website it serves by typing localhost:5000 in the address field of my browser.\r\nThis site should also be accessible from other devices in our LAN (including WiFi). So It should serve to its IP address. I type 192.168.1.42 in the address field of the same browser on the same machine that worked with localhost. And it fails.\n\r\n[Edit]\r\nFailing means that Firefox displays a cartoon of baby Godzilla with a power plug and matching reception that he just unplugged (?)\r\nThe text reads (my translation from German):\r\n\"Error: Connection failed.\r\nFirefox cannot establish a connection to the server under 192.168.1.42:5000.\r\no The website might temporarily be unavailable. Please try again later\r\no If you also cannot reach other web sites, check your network or internet connection.\r\no If your computer or network is protected by a proxy or firewall, ensure that Firefox is allowed to access the internet\"\r\n[/Edit]\r\nI created a firewall rule, even deactivated the firewall altogether, but to no avail. That doesn't seem to be my problem.\n\r\nI'm on Windows 10 Prof x64, python 3.8.2, Flask 1.1.2, Flask-SocketIO 4.3.2, if that matters.\n\r\nHow do I get access to the running web server from locations in our LAN other than localhost?\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\r\n+ Created a firewall rule for port 5000\r\n+ Deactivated firewall\r\n+ Started the SocketIO application with parameterPython\n\r\nsocketio.run(app, host=\"192.168.1.42:5000\")\r\n[Edit]\r\n+ Other parameterPython\n\r\nsocketio.run(app, host=\"192.168.1.42:5000\", cors_allowed_origins='*')[/Edit]\r\n[Edit2]\r\n+ Other ip addressPython\n\r\nsocketio.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0:5000\", cors_allowed_origins='*')[/Edit2]\n\r\n[Edit3]\r\nMy problem definitely comes from the application, not the system.\r\nProof: I didn't start my application, but\n\r\n$ winpty python -m http.server 5000instead, checked with firefox on the same machine to open the url 192.168.1.42 and also from an Android phone in the same LAN. Both work flawlessly (get access to the very directory python has been started in).\r\n[/Edit3]\r\n\t\t    ",

        "content": "\r\n\t\t\t    Hi forum,\n\r\nthere is a python program using flask and socket.io to create a web server which runs on my development machine. On the same machine, I can access the server and get the website it serves by typing localhost:5000 in the address field of my browser.\r\nThis site should also be accessible from other devices in our LAN (including WiFi). So It should serve to its IP address. I type 192.168.1.42 in the address field of the same browser on the same machine that worked with localhost. And it fails.\n\r\n[Edit]\r\nFailing means that Firefox displays a cartoon of baby Godzilla with a power plug and matching reception that he just unplugged (?)\r\nThe text reads (my translation from German):\r\n\"Error: Connection failed.\r\nFirefox cannot establish a connection to the server under 192.168.1.42:5000.\r\no The website might temporarily be unavailable. Please try again later\r\no If you also cannot reach other web sites, check your network or internet connection.\r\no If your computer or network is protected by a proxy or firewall, ensure that Firefox is allowed to access the internet\"\r\n[/Edit]\r\nI created a firewall rule, even deactivated the firewall altogether, but to no avail. That doesn't seem to be my problem.\n\r\nI'm on Windows 10 Prof x64, python 3.8.2, Flask 1.1.2, Flask-SocketIO 4.3.2, if that matters.\n\r\nHow do I get access to the running web server from locations in our LAN other than localhost?\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\r\n+ Created a firewall rule for port 5000\r\n+ Deactivated firewall\r\n+ Started the SocketIO application with parameterPython\n\r\nsocketio.run(app, host=\"192.168.1.42:5000\")\r\n[Edit]\r\n+ Other parameterPython\n\r\nsocketio.run(app, host=\"192.168.1.42:5000\", cors_allowed_origins='*')[/Edit]\r\n[Edit2]\r\n+ Other ip addressPython\n\r\nsocketio.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0:5000\", cors_allowed_origins='*')[/Edit2]\n\r\n[Edit3]\r\nMy problem definitely comes from the application, not the system.\r\nProof: I didn't start my application, but\n\r\n$ winpty python -m http.server 5000instead, checked with firefox on the same machine to open the url 192.168.1.42 and also from an Android phone in the same LAN. Both work flawlessly (get access to the very directory python has been started in).\r\n[/Edit3]\r\n\t\t    ",
