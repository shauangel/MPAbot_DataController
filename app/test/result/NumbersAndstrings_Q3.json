Point, blank, period. Modules CAN contain functions AND methods. Functions are attributes of a module, methods are attributes of an object / class.\n\nTry and keep this in your head: `object.attribute`. That period is like saying, \u201clet me access any attribute attached to this object.\u201d \n\nIn example two, you import the `random` module. The random module has all these cool functions that you can use.\n\nI\u2019m not too familiar with `randint`, but I\u2019m assuming it chooses a number from a range of numbers.\n\nExample:\n\n    import random\n    x = random.randint(1, 8) # Let me use the randint() function from the random module.\n\nIn the third example you posted, you could do that as well. Instead of `import random`, you would `from random import randint`. This is like saying \u201cI just want this function from the module and nothing else.\u201d\n\n    from random import randint\n    x = randint(1, 8) \n\nA method belongs to an object / class. There\u2019s different types of data types in Python. String, Integer, List, Tuple, etc. Some of these have methods that only belong to that data type. Some data types are similar so they share a few of the same methods.\n\nTry typing into a file:\n\n    x = \u2018test\u2019\n    print(x.upper())\n\nIf you understand how variables work, you understand that x represents a STRING. `upper()` belongs to the STRING data type / class (I\u2019m a beginner myself so I\u2019m using these interchangeably. I\u2019m assuming all the main data types in Python are classes).\n\nNext, try typing in:\n\n    x = \u2018test\u2019\n    print(x.len())\n\nThen type in:\n\n    x = \u2018test\u2019\n    print(len(x))\n\nYou\u2019ll see what happens. Then you\u2019ll realize that `len` is a function. It doesn\u2019t belong to any certain data type.  You\u2019ll also realize that `upper` is a method. It belongs to a certain data type...... a string. \n\nCaution: there are some data types that only certain functions work for, which you\u2019ll learn.\n\nI hope this clears up a few things. Again, I\u2019m a beginner, for anyone who wants to correct anything I said, feel free to.\n\nFirst off, thank you for being so thorough and I *think* I understand. I think my problem was that I was blurring the terminologies class/data type and module together to mean the same thing. Basically, I was mentally treating random like a class that had the attributes aka the \"methods\" randint, randrange, etc. \n\nAlso, I think it's the dot notation that was tripping me up because like your example shows len() isn't a string method because it's not an attribute of the string data type. Yet functions within a module can use dot notation. Simply put I was thinking dot notation = method. \n\nSo, just to make sure I'm understanding modules aren't classes or objects, they can contain those things (along with methods and functions) but they aren't those things? They are something else entirely? \n\nOnce again, thank you so much for helping me!\n\nA module isn\u2019t a class, you\u2019re right.

Otherwise you'll have to do a lot of if-statements.\n\n    #include <iostream>\n    #include <string>\n    #include <unordered_map>\n    \n    void PrintBaggins() \n    { \n        std::cout << \"Baggins\\n\"; \n    }\n    \n    void PrintWorld() \n    { \n        std::cout << \"World\\n\"; \n    }\n    \n    void Register(std::unordered_map<std::string, void(*)(void)>& outMap) \n    { \n        outMap[\"Hello\"] = &PrintWorld; \n        outMap[\"Frodo\"] = &PrintBaggins; \n    }\n    \n    int main() \n    { \n        std::unordered_map<std::string, void(*)(void)> functionMap;\n        Register(functionMap);\n        std::string input = \"\";\n        std::cin >> input;\n    \n        if (functionMap.find(input) != functionMap.end())\n        {\n    \tfunctionMap[input]();\n        }\n    \n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    if (functionMap.find(input) != functionMap.end())\n    {\n    functionMap[input]();\n    }\n\nThat's a bad idea.

Using a non-const reference circumvents copy elision. Also, you can use `string_view` for keys.

Now consider that the whole table is known at compile time. But we don't have a compile time associative containers in the standard. One could use `std::array<std::pair<K, V>>`, but that would only get us to `O(log(n))` lookup, instead of `O(1)`.

If you are unfamiliar entirely, try to find a tutorial or explanation of classes in Python, it's a bit too complex to explain here in one comment.\n\nBut I'll try anyway haha.. Programming languages like Python, C++, Java and probably many more are called Object-Orientated languages because they support classes and objects. So this concept is not unique to Python. Classes are a step up from functions. They are a way to store both data and functionality in one place. For example, a class \"String\" might have both the underlying data of the string, the characters, but also contain functionality that you may want to use to modify or extract that data. For example, common functionality you may want to do with a String, is convert it to lowercase, or split it on a delimiter, or add it to another String. You could have separate functions for these, but with a class, you can put the functionality in the class. Those functions then belong to the class, and act on instances of the class.\n\nThat's what's happening when you do s.split() or \"\".join(), both of these are member functions of the class string. \n\nHonestly, I don't think you will understand it from my quick description, but hopefully you know where to look now for more info!\n\nWhat this guy said. If classes are too advanced at the moment, just remember this:\n\n    restricted_word = 'mudblood'\n\n    restricted_word.upper()\n    # is /sort of/ the same as:\n    str.upper('restricted word')\n    # <str> refers to the __builtins__.str class.\n\nMethods will pass the data it\u2019s associated with to the call as an argument.

You\u2019ll see an outline of these things that look like functions that are made using **def** only they will be specific to that class.

Are you sure that you want to do something like that ? What is the reason behind that ?\r\nIf you really want to do something like that, I would integrate a script language inside your C++ app.\n\r\nIn your example, you not only need to give the name of the function name but the user has to also provides the parameters for the function. Imagine when you have a lot of different functions, with different parameter types and number, you'll need to make sure everything is correct.\n\r\nIf I had to do something like that, I would do it this way: I wouldn't have the different functions but each \"function\" would in fact be a class inheriting from a base class (something like CBaseOperation). The base class has virtual functions to ask for the parameters and to execute the operation. Each sub-class would then implement those functions in order to ask for the correct number of parameters and check their type. Then they also implement the function to execute the operation.\n\r\nFinally, all these classes are registered in a factory class (which is just a wrapper around a map, with the operation name being the key and an instance of the class being the value). When the user enters the function name, the program looks in the map to see if the object exists and call the askParameters function then the executeOperation function (or whatever names).\n\r\nThis is I think one elegant and flexible way to solve your problem, but are you really sure that it is what you want to do ?\r\n", "id": "2_90806_1", "owner_tier": 0.5, "score": 5.0}, {"content": "\r\n    You're going to have to look into reflection and possibly expressions(that is a field I'm not an expert in) to be able to do this.

Point, blank, period. Modules CAN contain functions AND methods. Functions are attributes of a module, methods are attributes of an object / class.\n\nTry and keep this in your head: `object.attribute`. That period is like saying, \u201clet me access any attribute attached to this object.\u201d \n\nIn example two, you import the `random` module. The random module has all these cool functions that you can use.\n\nI\u2019m not too familiar with `randint`, but I\u2019m assuming it chooses a number from a range of numbers.\n\nExample:\n\n    import random\n    x = random.randint(1, 8) # Let me use the randint() function from the random module.\n\nIn the third example you posted, you could do that as well. Instead of `import random`, you would `from random import randint`. This is like saying \u201cI just want this function from the module and nothing else.\u201d\n\n    from random import randint\n    x = randint(1, 8) \n\nA method belongs to an object / class. There\u2019s different types of data types in Python. String, Integer, List, Tuple, etc. Some of these have methods that only belong to that data type. Some data types are similar so they share a few of the same methods.\n\nTry typing into a file:\n\n    x = \u2018test\u2019\n    print(x.upper())\n\nIf you understand how variables work, you understand that x represents a STRING. `upper()` belongs to the STRING data type / class (I\u2019m a beginner myself so I\u2019m using these interchangeably. I\u2019m assuming all the main data types in Python are classes).\n\nNext, try typing in:\n\n    x = \u2018test\u2019\n    print(x.len())\n\nThen type in:\n\n    x = \u2018test\u2019\n    print(len(x))\n\nYou\u2019ll see what happens. Then you\u2019ll realize that `len` is a function. It doesn\u2019t belong to any certain data type.  You\u2019ll also realize that `upper` is a method. It belongs to a certain data type...... a string. \n\nCaution: there are some data types that only certain functions work for, which you\u2019ll learn.\n\nI hope this clears up a few things. Again, I\u2019m a beginner, for anyone who wants to correct anything I said, feel free to.\n\nFirst off, thank you for being so thorough and I *think* I understand. I think my problem was that I was blurring the terminologies class/data type and module together to mean the same thing. Basically, I was mentally treating random like a class that had the attributes aka the \"methods\" randint, randrange, etc. \n\nAlso, I think it's the dot notation that was tripping me up because like your example shows len() isn't a string method because it's not an attribute of the string data type. Yet functions within a module can use dot notation. Simply put I was thinking dot notation = method. \n\nSo, just to make sure I'm understanding modules aren't classes or objects, they can contain those things (along with methods and functions) but they aren't those things? They are something else entirely? \n\nOnce again, thank you so much for helping me!\n\nA module isn\u2019t a class, you\u2019re right.

Follow along with the bouncing ball...\n\n    >>> class Foo():\n              def fun1():\n                 print('fun1') \n              def fun2():\n                 print('fun2')\n    >>> for key,val in Foo.__dict__.items():\n              print(key,':',val)\n        __module__ : __main__\n        fun1 : <function Foo.fun1 at 0x1062812f0>\n        fun2 : <function Foo.fun2 at 0x106281378>\n        __dict__ : <attribute '__dict__' of 'Foo' objects>\n        __weakref__ : <attribute '__weakref__' of 'Foo' objects>\n        __doc__ : None\n    >>> fob = Foo()\n    >>> for key,val in fob.__class__.__dict__.items():\n              print(key,':',val)\n        __module__ : __main__\n        fun1 : <function Foo.fun1 at 0x1062812f0>\n        fun2 : <function Foo.fun2 at 0x106281378>\n        __dict__ : <attribute '__dict__' of 'Foo' objects>\n        __weakref__ : <attribute '__weakref__' of 'Foo' objects>\n        __doc__ : None\n\nSo, given you can reference some `object`, then the value of\n\n    object.__class__.__dict__[methodName]\n\nis a method (or an index error) and\n\n    object.__class__.__dict__[methodName](args)\n\nis a call to that method. The problem now is one level higher, how to convert a string 'objectName' to a reference to that object? You have to know what *namespace* it lives in. In the above sequence, just executing code interactively, `fob` is a global. So its name is in the dictionary returned by the `globals()` built-in method.\n\n    >>> globals()['fob']\n        <__main__.Foo object at 0x1062840b8>\n\nSo you could do,\n\n    >>> objectName='fob'\n    >>> methodName='fun1'\n    >>> globals()[objectName].__class__.__dict__[methodName]()\n    fun1\n\nOf course if `objectName` is not the name of a global (and it likely wouldn't be in a real app) you have to know what dict it is named in.

If you are unfamiliar entirely, try to find a tutorial or explanation of classes in Python, it's a bit too complex to explain here in one comment.\n\nBut I'll try anyway haha.. Programming languages like Python, C++, Java and probably many more are called Object-Orientated languages because they support classes and objects. So this concept is not unique to Python. Classes are a step up from functions. They are a way to store both data and functionality in one place. For example, a class \"String\" might have both the underlying data of the string, the characters, but also contain functionality that you may want to use to modify or extract that data. For example, common functionality you may want to do with a String, is convert it to lowercase, or split it on a delimiter, or add it to another String. You could have separate functions for these, but with a class, you can put the functionality in the class. Those functions then belong to the class, and act on instances of the class.\n\nThat's what's happening when you do s.split() or \"\".join(), both of these are member functions of the class string. \n\nHonestly, I don't think you will understand it from my quick description, but hopefully you know where to look now for more info!\n\nWhat this guy said.
