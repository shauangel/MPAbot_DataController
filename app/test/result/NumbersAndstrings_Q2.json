The collection membership test has traditionally been bound to sequences; an object is a member of a collection if the collection is a sequence and contains an element equal to that object. However, it make sense for many other object types to support membership tests without being a sequence. In particular, dictionaries (for keys) and sets support membership testing. Python uses a fallback mechanism where it will check whether some (in this case) supports one of the following methods: First it checks whether some is a list or tuple: For the list and tuple types, x in y is true if and only if there exists an index i such that either x is y[i] or x == y[i] is true. Next it checks whether both argv and some are strings: For the Unicode and string types, x in y is true if and only if x is a substring of y. An equivalent test is y.find(x) != -1. Note, x and y need not be the same type; consequently, u'ab' in 'abc' will return True. Empty strings are always considered to be a substring of any other string, so \"\" in \"abc\" will return True. Now every object that implements a __contains__ method supports such in and not in test as is further described in the documentation: For user-defined classes which define the __contains__() method, x in y is true if and only if y.__contains__(x) is true. So besides implemented usages for dictionaries, tuples and lists, you can define your own __contains__ method for arbitrary objects. Another way to support this functionality is the following: For user-defined classes which do not define __contains__() but do define __iter__(), x in y is true if some value z with x == z is produced while iterating over y. If an exception is raised during the iteration, it is as if in raised that exception. And finally: Lastly, the old-style iteration protocol is tried: if a class defines __getitem__(), x in y is true if and only if there is a non-negative integer index i such that x == y[i], and all lower integer indices do not raise IndexError exception.

And there is no num1 and num2 variables so I don't get it why this is functioning.\n\nThe print statement is printing the \u201creturn\u201d from the add method. \nYou send two numbers to the \u201cadd\u201d method, which multiplies them and returns the result - then the print statement is run with the returned value.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean. In `print(add(2, 4))`, the arguments 2 and 4 are in the `add` argument list. 2 gets passed into the function and stored in `num1`, and 4 gets stored in `num2`. `print` doesn't have anything to do with this.

That's what the `()` after the name indicates. Why do you think otherwise? \n\nAnd it knows it needs to do multiplication because when `add` is called, it's function body is entered, and that body contains a call to `*`, which is multiplication.\n\nHey, not sure if I\u2019ll be able to help much, but the add() function is being called by the print statement.\n\nSo when you do print(add(2, 3)) that\u2019s using the print statement to call add with 2 and 3 as the arguments.\n\nI hope I explained that in a way that makes sense.\n\nIt can take a while to grasp some of this.

That line calls `add`.\n\nAnd you can create those variables in `main`, but they'll have no relation to the variables of the same name in `func`. You need to call the function to pass data to the function.\n\nYou could call `add(num1=2, num2=4)`; those are called *keyword arguments*.  However, in `add(2, 4)`, they're being passed as *positional arguments*.  \n\nWhen evaluating the expression `add(2, 4)`,  \n\n- The first argument, `2`, is bound to the first parameter, `num1`.  \n- The second argument, `4` is bound to the second parameter, `num2`.\n- `return num1 * num2` evaluates to `return 2 * 4`\n- `return 2 * 4` evaluates to `return 8`\n- `8` is returned to the caller\n\nThus, `print(add(2, 4))` evaluates as equivalent to `print(8)`\n\nthanks for answering but I still dont get it.

In the square braces, you can put up to three numbers separated by colons. The first number is the starting index, the second is the ending index, and the third is the number of steps to move by. For example, `\"Hello World\"[4:10:2]` returns `\"oWr\"`.\n\nIn the even/odd example, the starting index is num%2. In other words, if num is even, the starting index is 0, otherwise it's 1.

This results in the string \"even\" if num is even and the string \"odd\" if num is odd.\n\nPython ranges work like this list[start:end:step] where the sub list starts at the start index, ends before end index, and includes every step-th item within that. All three parameters are optional like list[:end:step], list[start::step] and list[start:end:] where the excluded start, end and step parameters are automatically taken to be 0, length of the list and 1 respectively.\n\nLook at the string again.\nEoVdEdN\n\nSo every other letter starting at 0, is 'even'.\nEvery other star letter starting from 1 is 'odd'.\n\n\"eovdedn\"[num%2::2] thus gives us the desired output.\n\nArray[x:y:z]\n\nX is starting index. Y is ending index. In this case it doesn't exist, so it is is end of string. Z is increment. So it starts at num%2 and increments by 2.\n\nOh, wow!

Ex: `List<String> words = new ArrayList<String>()`. Well in Java, you can only use classes as generic parameters, which means you can't create lists which store primitive variables (int, boolean, double, etc.). To solve this problem Java ~~introduced~~ has wrapper classes like `Integer`, `Boolean`, `Double`, etc. \n\nThen to make working with those easier Java used autoboxing and unboxing. Java automatically converts `int` to `Integer` (autoboxing) when needed. It also converts `Integer` to `int` when needed (unboxing).\n\nSo for: `10 == new Integer(10)`, Java automatically unboxes the `Integer` to compare with the `int` and returns true.\n\nHowever if you have: `new Integer(10) == new Integer(10)`, there is no autoboxing or unboxing since the type of both objects is the same, namely `Integer`. Java does object comparison, which compares if the two variables refer to the same object in memory, which they don't. It is like doing: `new String(\"hello\") == new String(\"hello\")`\n\n> To solve this problem Java introduced wrapper classes like Integer, Boolean, Double, etc.\n\nFYI: Object wrappers were in the language well before generics were. \n\nAh okay.

Am I right?\n\r\nNo matter, there is nothing wrong the idea of data exchange with a running thread; and knowing good techniques for that is very important.\n\r\nMy approach is working with the threads created through thread constructors is hiding both thread object and thread method in a thread wrapper. This techniques has more then one benefit. First of all, the thread method cam be an instance method (that is, non-static method) of the wrapper. This is the way to avoid ugly parametrized thread start, which is always bad because it requires a type case. With wrapper and an instance method, this is never needed because an the call to the instance method passes \"this\", a target reference as an implicit first parameter. In case of thread and a thread wrapper, this is the only parameter (as required by the thread constructor) and a reference to the instance of the wrapper. This way, the thread body gets access to all of the members of the wrapper class at once.\n\r\nMore than that, it helps to encapsulate the data accessible by both the wrapped thread and other threads. Making some members private guarantees that the data is used only in a wrapped thread. Other members can be done internal/private and used by more then one thread. If is advisable to provide such access only to the methods and properties. This way, access to the shared data can be synchronized with some thread synchronization primitives, such as lock statement, System.Threading.EventWaitHandle, System.Threading.ReaderWriterLockSlim, System.Threading.Monitor and the like \u2014 please see:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c5kehkcz%28v=vs.100%29.aspx[^],\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.eventwaithandle.aspx[^],\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.readerwriterlockslim.aspx[^],\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.monitor.aspx[^].\n\r\nWhat is really important, the use of the thread synchronization objects is hidden inside the wrapper; the objects cannot be misused by the code using the wrapper. Such misuse is a usual problem, so this is yet another considerable benefit.\n\r\nFor a sample code of a thread wrapper, please see my past answers:\nHow to pass ref parameter to the thread[^],\nchange paramters of thread (producer) after it started[^].\n\r\nThe code sample in the second answer demonstrates the use of lock statement.\n\n\u2014SA\n", "id": "2_366071_1", "owner_tier": 0.7, "score": 0}], "link": "https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/366003/Multi-Threading-Is-it-possible-to-return-data-out", "question": {"content": "\r\n\t\t\t    Hi Everyone,\r\nI'm a student who is creating a basic multi-threading program.

The Dates that do show, are in the format Year Month Day, but the year is either showing as 2008 or 1999, I would like all the Years to be 2009, as that is what the Timetable Year is.\n\r\nAnd what should be typed in the Code, to get the Data, to display in the order it was in, in the original Excel File.\n\r\nI say that because most if not all the Flypast appearances, don't show the date. So when the venues are shown, in alphabetical order, it makes it harder to know if the Flypast, was associated with a relevant display, i.e. when the aircraft were transiting to the display etc. If the Data is in the Original, non alphabetical order for the Venues, the relevant Flypasts should be underneath, I think, I may be wrong though.\n\r\nIn the Output, when I run the Python Code, I now have an additional Column, called Dakota and Fighters In The Same Display Slot. Because of the way, the data is collated, in the Source .xls File. Only the Venues, where the Aircraft are all in the same Display slot, Show here, I think because, when DAK and HS become DHS, as you will understand from the Code, and can see in the Original .XLS document when those values in the Duration Column i.e. Durn don't match i.e. 0:05 and 0:10, i.e. 5 and 10 minutes they don't show in the Output. \n\r\nOnly when both values, are the same do they show.

This is when the Date isn't present, in the 'Date' Column, in Rows Of Data in the .xls File. I.e. the Layout, of the Data in the .xls File being the issue.

Winch\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\r\nUpdate To Code, With Question :-\n\r\nI have added the following to my Code :-\n\n \n\r\ndf[\"Date\"].fillna(method='ffill', inplace = True)\n\r\nInplace of :-\n\n \n\r\ndf[\"Date\"].fillna(\"No Date\", inplace = True)\n\r\nSo that the 'No Dates', showing in the 'Date' Column for the Rows, now have been filled with the correct Date, bar the Year part, i.e. 2008, which should say 2009, I am not sure how to rectify that ?\n\r\nIn the following Part of my Code :-\n\n \n\r\n<pre>#convert df['Durn'] column to datetime format\r\ndf['Durn']= pd.to_datetime(df['Durn'],format='%H:%M:%S').apply(pd.Timestamp)\r\n#print(\"changing datatype of column Durn----->\",df['Durn'].dtype)\r\n#print(\"=======\")\r\n\r\n#compare minutes with extracting

----->\",df['Durn'].dtype)\r\n#print(\"=======\")\n\r\nWhat will I need to change, so that the Rows not showing, due to the non matching values in the 'Durn' Column, do show and have NO showing in the 'Dakota And Fighters In The Same Display Slot' Column, for those Rows ? For the matching values, in comparelist=[5,10,15,20,] if they match they occupy both rows, the same Value, so 5+5 = 10, 10+10 = 20, 15+15 = 30, 20+20 = 40. \n\r\nWhereas for those that don't match, i.e. 5 in one row and 10 in the other, 5+10 = 15. How would I write Code, to achieve what I am getting at ? Any help would be appreciated\n\r\nUpdate 2 :-\n\r\nI have added the following two lines to my Code :-\n\n \n\r\ndf['Date']= pd.to_datetime(df['Date'],format='%Y-%m-%d')\r\ndf['Date']= pd.to_datetime(df['Date']).dt.strftime('%d-%m-%Y')\n\r\nSo now the Dates are in the Date Format I want, bar the Year showing 2008, which I want showing as 2009. Also I want the Rows, going descending, in relation to the 'Date' Column, earliest Date to the Latest Date, in the DataFrame Output. What would I need to type, to achieve this ?\n\r\nRegards\n\r\nEddie Winch\r\n\t\t    ", "id": "5257546", "title": "I need help finishing off my Python code", "traffic_rate": 0}, "saved_time": 1721101602, "source": "codeproject", "tags": ["Python", "MS-Excel"]}, {"answers": [{"content": "\r\n    It prints only \"incredibly\" because that is what you - or the author of that code at least - told it to do:\nJava\n\r\nconsole.log(sorted[0]);\r\nIf you want it to pint more than one word, you need to tell it to print them, either by adding more lines:\nJava\n\r\nconsole.log(sorted[0]);\r\nconsole.log(sorted[1]);\r\n...\r\nconsole.log(sorted[sorted.length - 1]);Or by using a loop.\r\n", "id": "2_5308639_1", "owner_tier": 0.9, "score": 0}, {"content": "\r\n    Just add two lines:\n\n\r\nsortedAll = sorted\r\nconsole.log(sortedAll);\r\n Result - (6) [\"incredibly\", \"genuinelys\", \"elephant\", \"orange\", \"Lions\", \"are\"]\r\nsorted[5] will give you the 6th element of your array - the shortest.\n", "id": "2_5310111_1", "owner_tier": 0.1, "score": 0}], "link": "https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/5308637/How-do-I-make-a-function-that-takes-an-array-list", "question": {"content": "\r\n\t\t\t    I am new to programming and javascript. \r\nI am struggling to understand how to make this code print out all the strings that are longer in the array.\n\r\nI want to write a function that takes in an array of strings and then prints out the longest one\n\r\nfor example: longestWord([\"the\",\"fresh\",\"green\", \"dog\", \"chased\", \"my\", \"chickens\"])\n\r\nshould print: chickens\n\r\nAnd If there are multiple longest strings then print them all in a different line.\n\r\nfor example: longestWord([\"what\", \"about\", \"elephants\", \"and\", \"a\", \"crocodile\"])\n\r\nshould print: \nelephants\r\ncrocodile\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\nJavaScript\n\r\nlet array = [\"Lions\", \"are\", \"incredibly\", \"elephant\", \"orange\", \"genuinelys\"];\r\n\r\nlet sorted = array.sort(function (a, b){\r\n     return b.length - a.length;\r\n});\r\n\r\nconsole.log(sorted[0]);\n\n//This prints out only \"incredibly\"\n", "id": "5308637", "title": "How do I make a function that takes an array list and prints out the longest words?", "traffic_rate": 0}, "saved_time": 1721101602, "source": "codeproject", "tags": ["Javascript"]}, {"answers": [{"content": "You are calling random.randint twice in each iteration of the loop.

When you use x in y, that is a shortcut for y.__contains__(x)1.  When you define a class, you can define your own __contains__ method that can actually return anything you want.

The collection membership test has traditionally been bound to sequences; an object is a member of a collection if the collection is a sequence and contains an element equal to that object. However, it make sense for many other object types to support membership tests without being a sequence. In particular, dictionaries (for keys) and sets support membership testing. Python uses a fallback mechanism where it will check whether some (in this case) supports one of the following methods: First it checks whether some is a list or tuple: For the list and tuple types, x in y is true if and only if there exists an index i such that either x is y[i] or x == y[i] is true. Next it checks whether both argv and some are strings: For the Unicode and string types, x in y is true if and only if x is a substring of y. An equivalent test is y.find(x) != -1. Note, x and y need not be the same type; consequently, u'ab' in 'abc' will return True. Empty strings are always considered to be a substring of any other string, so \"\" in \"abc\" will return True. Now every object that implements a __contains__ method supports such in and not in test as is further described in the documentation: For user-defined classes which define the __contains__() method, x in y is true if and only if y.__contains__(x) is true. So besides implemented usages for dictionaries, tuples and lists, you can define your own __contains__ method for arbitrary objects. Another way to support this functionality is the following: For user-defined classes which do not define __contains__() but do define __iter__(), x in y is true if some value z with x == z is produced while iterating over y. If an exception is raised during the iteration, it is as if in raised that exception. And finally: Lastly, the old-style iteration protocol is tried: if a class defines __getitem__(), x in y is true if and only if there is a non-negative integer index i such that x == y[i], and all lower integer indices do not raise IndexError exception.

In `print(add(2, 4))`, the arguments 2 and 4 are in the `add` argument list. 2 gets passed into the function and stored in `num1`, and 4 gets stored in `num2`. `print` doesn't have anything to do with this.

That's what the `()` after the name indicates. Why do you think otherwise? \n\nAnd it knows it needs to do multiplication because when `add` is called, it's function body is entered, and that body contains a call to `*`, which is multiplication.\n\nHey, not sure if I\u2019ll be able to help much, but the add() function is being called by the print statement.\n\nSo when you do print(add(2, 3)) that\u2019s using the print statement to call add with 2 and 3 as the arguments.\n\nI hope I explained that in a way that makes sense.\n\nIt can take a while to grasp some of this.

That line calls `add`.\n\nAnd you can create those variables in `main`, but they'll have no relation to the variables of the same name in `func`. You need to call the function to pass data to the function.\n\nYou could call `add(num1=2, num2=4)`; those are called *keyword arguments*.  However, in `add(2, 4)`, they're being passed as *positional arguments*.  \n\nWhen evaluating the expression `add(2, 4)`,  \n\n- The first argument, `2`, is bound to the first parameter, `num1`.  \n- The second argument, `4` is bound to the second parameter, `num2`.\n- `return num1 * num2` evaluates to `return 2 * 4`\n- `return 2 * 4` evaluates to `return 8`\n- `8` is returned to the caller\n\nThus, `print(add(2, 4))` evaluates as equivalent to `print(8)`\n\nthanks for answering but I still dont get it.

And python's ternary if statements are a bit odd because you can't structure them on multiple lines, so it's nearly always better to just use an if. I think that might even be the point.\n\n`return \u201codd\u201d if num % 2 else \u201ceven\u201d`\n\nI like that one better\n\nWell now that's even more confusing since you have a numerical output and a boolean input, even if they are isomorphic.

The inline if-expression is the devil, has no obvious structure and looks like line noise.\n\nIt's clean, it's readable, it respects types. Even and odd are after all a special case where you just happen to have two possibilities. However, I think just making an entirely standard, entirely ordinary function is the most pythonic way to \"inline\" this. \n\nConsider where you would actually use something like an inline if:\n\n    imagine + this_is((\"odd\" if n % 2 == 0 else \"even\")[an_expression])\n\nYou can certainly make it shorter using these methods:\n\n    imagine + this_is((\"odd\" if n % 2 else \"even\")[an_expression])\n    imagine + this_is([\"even\", \"odd\"][n % 2][an_expression])\n    imagine + this_is(\"eovdedn\"[n % 2 :: 2][an_expression])  \n\nBut every single way is confusing and most importantly none of these is exactly beautiful or the obvious way of doing this.

Can someone explain to me what ``\"eovdedn\"[num%2::2]`` does?\n\nI see the modulus, but that's about the only part I understand.\n\nPython can do something called list slicing. In the square braces, you can put up to three numbers separated by colons. The first number is the starting index, the second is the ending index, and the third is the number of steps to move by. For example, `\"Hello World\"[4:10:2]` returns `\"oWr\"`.\n\nIn the even/odd example, the starting index is num%2. In other words, if num is even, the starting index is 0, otherwise it's 1. No ending index is given, so it will go until the end of the string. The step size is 2, so it will move by two characters each time. This results in the string \"even\" if num is even and the string \"odd\" if num is odd.\n\nPython ranges work like this list[start:end:step] where the sub list starts at the start index, ends before end index, and includes every step-th item within that. All three parameters are optional like list[:end:step], list[start::step] and list[start:end:] where the excluded start, end and step parameters are automatically taken to be 0, length of the list and 1 respectively.\n\nLook at the string again.\nEoVdEdN\n\nSo every other letter starting at 0, is 'even'.\nEvery other star letter starting from 1 is 'odd'.\n\n\"eovdedn\"[num%2::2] thus gives us the desired output.\n\nArray[x:y:z]\n\nX is starting index. Y is ending index. In this case it doesn't exist, so it is is end of string. Z is increment. So it starts at num%2 and increments by 2.\n\nOh, wow!

Java automatically converts `int` to `Integer` (autoboxing) when needed.

Am I right?\n\r\nNo matter, there is nothing wrong the idea of data exchange with a running thread; and knowing good techniques for that is very important.\n\r\nMy approach is working with the threads created through thread constructors is hiding both thread object and thread method in a thread wrapper. This techniques has more then one benefit. First of all, the thread method cam be an instance method (that is, non-static method) of the wrapper. This is the way to avoid ugly parametrized thread start, which is always bad because it requires a type case. With wrapper and an instance method, this is never needed because an the call to the instance method passes \"this\", a target reference as an implicit first parameter. In case of thread and a thread wrapper, this is the only parameter (as required by the thread constructor) and a reference to the instance of the wrapper. This way, the thread body gets access to all of the members of the wrapper class at once.\n\r\nMore than that, it helps to encapsulate the data accessible by both the wrapped thread and other threads. Making some members private guarantees that the data is used only in a wrapped thread. Other members can be done internal/private and used by more then one thread. If is advisable to provide such access only to the methods and properties. This way, access to the shared data can be synchronized with some thread synchronization primitives, such as lock statement, System.Threading.EventWaitHandle, System.Threading.ReaderWriterLockSlim, System.Threading.Monitor and the like \u2014 please see:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c5kehkcz%28v=vs.100%29.aspx[^],\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.eventwaithandle.aspx[^],\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.readerwriterlockslim.aspx[^],\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.monitor.aspx[^].\n\r\nWhat is really important, the use of the thread synchronization objects is hidden inside the wrapper; the objects cannot be misused by the code using the wrapper.

The Dates that do show, are in the format Year Month Day, but the year is either showing as 2008 or 1999, I would like all the Years to be 2009, as that is what the Timetable Year is.\n\r\nAnd what should be typed in the Code, to get the Data, to display in the order it was in, in the original Excel File.\n\r\nI say that because most if not all the Flypast appearances, don't show the date. So when the venues are shown, in alphabetical order, it makes it harder to know if the Flypast, was associated with a relevant display, i.e. when the aircraft were transiting to the display etc. If the Data is in the Original, non alphabetical order for the Venues, the relevant Flypasts should be underneath, I think, I may be wrong though.\n\r\nIn the Output, when I run the Python Code, I now have an additional Column, called Dakota and Fighters In The Same Display Slot. Because of the way, the data is collated, in the Source .xls File. Only the Venues, where the Aircraft are all in the same Display slot, Show here, I think because, when DAK and HS become DHS, as you will understand from the Code, and can see in the Original .XLS document when those values in the Duration Column i.e. Durn don't match i.e. 0:05 and 0:10, i.e. 5 and 10 minutes they don't show in the Output. \n\r\nOnly when both values, are the same do they show. I.e. when DHS are all in the same display slot, although for some reason for the Venue Woodstock, where both values are 0:15 The Row isn't showing, any ideas, why that is the case ?\r\nThe Woodstock Row, wasn't showing before either, can't work out why.\n\r\nSo all those Rows Showing, but in the, \"In The Same Display Slot\" Column I would like all The Venue Rows, where they are in the same Display Slot saying YES and the ones that are not in the same display slot saying NO. \n\r\nAlso I have noticed, that in the Date Column, it says No Date in the DataFrame Output. This is when the Date isn't present, in the 'Date' Column, in Rows Of Data in the .xls File. I.e. the Layout, of the Data in the .xls File being the issue. I have all the YES's bar the Venue 'WOODSTOCK' showing in the Dakota And Fighters In the Same Display Slot Column, and now would all the 'NO' Rows to show.\n\n\n\r\nHere is a Link to a Picture, of a sample of the .xls File Data. Is there a way, to have the Date populate, the empty Columns in the Rows with Data in, up to the right point in the Dataframe ?\r\n\r\nHere is the link, to a Picture of what I mean :-\r\n\r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/153177973@N08/49330715541/in/dateposted-public/\r\n\r\nKembles's DHS appearance on the 20th June, won't show a date in the DataFrame, as that Data is missing from that Row.

Winch\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\r\nUpdate To Code, With Question :-\n\r\nI have added the following to my Code :-\n\n \n\r\ndf[\"Date\"].fillna(method='ffill', inplace = True)\n\r\nInplace of :-\n\n \n\r\ndf[\"Date\"].fillna(\"No Date\", inplace = True)\n\r\nSo that the 'No Dates', showing in the 'Date' Column for the Rows, now have been filled with the correct Date, bar the Year part, i.e. 2008, which should say 2009, I am not sure how to rectify that ?\n\r\nIn the following Part of my Code :-\n\n \n\r\n<pre>#convert df['Durn'] column to datetime format\r\ndf['Durn']= pd.to_datetime(df['Durn'],format='%H:%M:%S').apply(pd.Timestamp)\r\n#print(\"changing datatype of column Durn----->\",df['Durn'].dtype)\r\n#print(\"=======\")\r\n\r\n#compare minutes with extracting

'Dakota And Fighters In The Same Display Slot' Column, for those Rows ? For the matching values, in comparelist=[5,10,15,20,] if they match they occupy both rows, the same Value, so 5+5 = 10, 10+10 = 20, 15+15 = 30, 20+20 = 40. \n\r\nWhereas for those that don't match, i.e. 5 in one row and 10 in the other, 5+10 = 15. How would I write Code, to achieve what I am getting at ? Any help would be appreciated\n\r\nUpdate 2 :-\n\r\nI have added the following two lines to my Code :-\n\n \n\r\ndf['Date']= pd.to_datetime(df['Date'],format='%Y-%m-%d')\r\ndf['Date']= pd.to_datetime(df['Date']).dt.strftime('%d-%m-%Y')\n\r\nSo now the Dates are in the Date Format I want, bar the Year showing 2008, which I want showing as 2009. Also I want the Rows, going descending, in relation to the 'Date' Column, earliest Date to the Latest Date, in the DataFrame Output. What would I need to type, to achieve this ?\n\r\nRegards\n\r\nEddie Winch\r\n\t\t    ", "id": "5257546", "title": "I need help finishing off my Python code", "traffic_rate": 0}, "saved_time": "Tue, 16 Jul 2024 03:46:42 GMT", "source": "codeproject", "tags": ["Python", "MS-Excel"]}, {"answers": [{"content": "\r\n    It prints only \"incredibly\" because that is what you - or the author of that code at least - told it to do:\nJava\n\r\nconsole.log(sorted[0]);\r\nIf you want it to pint more than one word, you need to tell it to print them, either by adding more lines:\nJava\n\r\nconsole.log(sorted[0]);\r\nconsole.log(sorted[1]);\r\n...\r\nconsole.log(sorted[sorted.length - 1]);Or by using a loop.\r\n", "id": "2_5308639_1", "owner_tier": 0.9, "score": 0}, {"content": "\r\n    Just add two lines:\n\n\r\nsortedAll = sorted\r\nconsole.log(sortedAll);\r\n Result - (6) [\"incredibly\", \"genuinelys\", \"elephant\", \"orange\", \"Lions\", \"are\"]\r\nsorted[5] will give you the 6th element of your array - the shortest.\n", "id": "2_5310111_1", "owner_tier": 0.1, "score": 0}], "link": "https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/5308637/How-do-I-make-a-function-that-takes-an-array-list", "question": {"content": "\r\n\t\t\t    I am new to programming and javascript. \r\nI am struggling to understand how to make this code print out all the strings that are longer in the array.\n\r\nI want to write a function that takes in an array of strings and then prints out the longest one\n\r\nfor example: longestWord([\"the\",\"fresh\",\"green\", \"dog\", \"chased\", \"my\", \"chickens\"])\n\r\nshould print: chickens\n\r\nAnd If there are multiple longest strings then print them all in a different line.\n\r\nfor example: longestWord([\"what\", \"about\", \"elephants\", \"and\", \"a\", \"crocodile\"])\n\r\nshould print: \nelephants\r\ncrocodile\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\nJavaScript\n\r\nlet array = [\"Lions\", \"are\", \"incredibly\", \"elephant\", \"orange\", \"genuinelys\"];\r\n\r\nlet sorted = array.sort(function (a, b){\r\n     return b.length - a.length;\r\n});\r\n\r\nconsole.log(sorted[0]);\n\n//This prints out only \"incredibly\"\n", "id": "5308637", "title": "How do I make a function that takes an array list and prints out the longest words?", "traffic_rate": 0}, "saved_time": "Tue, 16 Jul 2024 03:46:42 GMT", "source": "codeproject", "tags": ["Javascript"]}]}
