(It doesn't even matter if the assignment is executed or not - as long as an assignment exists in a function, the variable being assigned to will be considered a local variable of that function.) Since the statement ctr += 1 includes an assignment to ctr, python thinks that ctr is local to the inner function. Consequently, it never even tries to look at the value of the ctr variable that's been defined in outer. What python sees is essentially this: And I think we can all agree that this code would cause an error, since ctr is being accessed before it has been defined. (See also the docs or this question for more details about how python decides the scope of a variable.) Python 3 has introduced the nonlocal statement, which works much like the global statement, but lets us access variables of the surrounding function (rather than global variables). Simply add nonlocal ctr at the top of the innerfunction and the problem will go away: Since the nonlocal statement doesn't exist in python 2, we have to be crafty. There are two easy workarounds: Removing all assignments to ctr Since python only considers ctr a local variable because there's an assignment to that variable, the problem will go away if we remove all assignments to the name ctr.

I *think* the root problem was that A was calling functions/classes from B and C, and C was calling functions from B, and everythgin was happy ... until I moved code into B that called stuff from C, leading to an import loop (A calling B calling C calling B and crashing).

I then want to roll the range forward so that I can train on weeks 14-65 and test the next 13 weeks and so on until I'm at the end of my data set and what I have is a df_results with the weekly observations and their probabilities that I can do some stuff with.\n\n\nI'm stuck in getting the range loop/rolling window to work via a weekly index rather than just using the position of an observation in the df. \n\n\nIf I try put it into pseudocode it might look something like this:\n\n    start_week = 0\n    end_week = 52\n    test_week = 65\n    for range(start_week:end_week) in dataframe:\n        train_set = df[start_week:end_week]\n        test_set = df[end_week:test_week]\n        svm.train(train_set)\n        svm.predict(test_set)\n        #gives the probability of a point being in either class\n        svm.predict_proba(test_set)\n        \n        #adds the probability from above to a df with the company and their share return for the dates in the test set\n        df_results[Class_0] = pd.dataframe(left column)\n        df_results[Class 1] = pd.dataframe(right column)\n\n        start_week, end_week, test_week += 13\n\n\n    return df_results\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\n\nTL;DR: I want to loop through a date range for predicting values using an SVM, update the range, predict again etc etc all while adding the results to a dataframe that I can then use to do some calculations. \n\n\nedit: I should add that I've got this running fine when I just keep the week static - so only doing this for a period where I know the exact positions in the array.

Many IDE's like PyCharm feature a linter as well, which works very practical like the spelling check in a word editor.\n\nAnother issue is that you're using globals to distribute values between functions. While that's allowed by the language, it's usually advised against because \n\n* if you import your code in another script then the globals could collide with other globals \n* but they also prevent the user that imports the functions to use them separately, the functions currently only function when the globals exist\n* the code can get harder to read and understand as globals tend to appear 'out of nowhere' in functions \n* you need to allow reassignment in every function where you want to reassign it, as you're doing with `global`\n\nand possibly other cons as well.

The idiom allows you to execute the code under the `if` only if the file is run as the initial code.  If the code is imported, the code under the `if` statement doesn't execute.\n\nThe reason why that works is [explained here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html).  In short, the `__name__` variable is a module attribute that is automatically given a value.  If you import the module *fred.py* then the attribute `__name__` will be \"fred\".  If you execute the file *fred.py* as the initial code the `__name__` attribute has the value \"\\_\\_main\\_\\_\".\n\nI sometimes use `if __name__ == '__main__':` if I am writing a simple utility that I think could be valuable as an import library and as a command line tool.

If you can't change the JSON format there are things you can do to make life easier.\n\nAs an example, if the JSON data is a dictionary containing lists as values, with the list being a collection of sub-dictionaries, you must first lookup the dictionary to get the list of interest, then index into the list to get the sub-dictionary you want, and then lookup that dictionary to get the final value.  Doing that in python might look like this:\n\n    list1 = json_dict[key1]\n    sub_dict = list1[3]\n    value = sub_dict[key2]\n\nor\n\n    value = json_dict[key1][3][key2]  # same as above\n\nIf you find yourself often doing `json_dict[key1][3]` and just changing `key2`, in a loop perhaps, then you can \"hoist\" that expression out of the loop by assigning it to a helper variable.  So instead of:\n\n    for key2 in some_sequence:\n        value = json_dict[key1][3][key2]\n        # process \"value\"\n\ndo this:\n    \n    sub_dict = json_dict[key1][3]\n    for key2 in some_sequence:\n        value = sub_dict[key2]\n        # process \"value\"\n\nIf you can't change the format of the JSON data to make your code simpler you have to do that complex lookup dance.

When doing something repetitively, you might want to use loops. You'll notice here you're doing some fairly repetitive things, with each thing changing slightly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's some sample code I made, you should be able to paste this and run it\n\n    money = 10.50 #random number here as a test\n    money = 10.50*100 #convert into cents\n    \n    listofcoins = [] #create a blank list\n    \n    #create a  list of denominations to use\n    Denominations = (\"Dollars\", \"Quarters\", \"Dimes\", \"Nickels\") \n    \n    #loop through and populate our blank list\n    for x in Denominations: \n        listofcoins.append([x])\n    #Once this code ^is done running we'll have a list of lists, where each denomination is just a string in it's own list. \n    \n    \n    #now we loop through and do the division steps in your code. for each result we just kind of squeeze it in the original list.\n    \n    for x,y  in enumerate((100,25,10,5)): \n        print(listofcoins) #including this just so you see how the list is changing with each iteration of the loop\n        listofcoins[x].append(money//y) \n        money = money%y\n    \n    \n    #print out our list\n    for x in listofcoins: \n        print(x[0], \" \", x[1])\n\nMy example doesn't include pennies because I forgot, but hopefully that helps you a bit. There is probably a bit more of a pythonic and cleaner way to do it, possibly but I think maybe just adding some loops to your code makes sense.\n\nIf you have any questions about this let me know, if you haven't seen some of this in python it might seem confusing but it's not too bad once you get past the syntactical weirdness.\n\nBut basically instead of having each denomination be it's own division step the way you had it, I tried to do it in a loop. For each calculation, we calculate using your formula of\n\nmoney//denomination\n\nand then I just append it to the list I had created.

Eg, suppose your directory structure is\n\n    package/\n        __main__.py\n        __init__.py\n        moduleA.py\n        moduleB.py\n        subpackage/\n            __init__.py\n            moduleC.py\n\n`__main__.py` is what you use to allow execution of the package itself. So in that file, you could do:\n\n    import sys\n    from .moduleA import main_a\n    from .moduleB import main_b\n\n    def main():\n        # highly recommend argparse for \n        # instead of sys.argv in real code \n        if sys.argv[1] == \"thingA\":\n            main_a()\n        if sys.argv[1] == \"thingB\":\n            main_b()\n        else:\n            print(f\"Error: Invalid option {sys.argv[1]}\")\n\n    # Call main only if told to execute \n    # rather than import this file\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        main()\n\nThen if, from the directory containing package, you run `python -m package`, the code in `__main__.py` can be run.\n\nThe `__init__.py` controls what happens if you import a package. Those file can be empty, but they are excellent places for a package docstring (description of what package is for) and also can be used to make `from package import *` work (but that way of importing is evil, so screw it), or to make sure you import the whole (or particular parts of) the package (which can be convenient, but can also be really inconvenient if it takes a long time to import anything). \n\nSo with `__init__.py` empty, if you `import package`, you don't really get anything. You can't do `package.moduleA.main_a()`, unless you explicitly do `import package.moduleA` first.\n\nIf you want to be able to access members of the package without explicitly importing them individually like that, then you could make an `__init__.py` like so:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    This package does something really \n    awesome, described here.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    from . import moduleA, moduleB, subpackage\n\nAnd that's it. Now you can import package and do `package.moduleA`. Put something similar is subpackage's `__init__.py` to be able to do `package.subpackage.moduleC`.\n\n**NOTE:** You'll notice that inside the package, I used what are called relative imports: `from . import thing`. I do this because if you do, the package works immediately, without doing any setup.py and installation / sys.path nonsense you'll read about online. Not that setup.py distutils installation etc aren't good things to know how to do, but I don't generally want to have to do them to just use the code I wrote. \n\nThis form of importing does impose a restriction that you can't do circular imports, but I think it's worthwhile.", "id": "hssdlaj", "parent": "t1_hsnps07", "vote": 2}, {"content": "Have you looked into Jupyter notebook?

EDIT: Also this syntax was deprecated and isn't in python3.  If you always use `except Exception as e` you can't get this error.  E.g., `except (ValueError, IndexError) as e`.   \n* 5 is a common programming mistake and has nothing to do with python.  You don't modify a list you are iterating over and expect everything to work.\n* 7 is another logical mistake.  You should avoid circular dependencies between modules and even when you don't there's an easy fix (import right before use).  Your code should generally be enclosed in functions and classes and not immediately invoked unless run by itself using the `if __name__ == '__main__':` idiom).\n* 4 is bad programming -- you shouldn't use mutable global variables.  Python assumes if a variable is assigned to that it will be local.  Yes, python lets some cases of mutable global variables get through (like appending to a list example).  Granted the fact that you can reference non-mutable global variables in functions and classes is very useful.  And adding `global x` to the function will allow you to mutate global variables if you really need to (not that you should).\n* 6 is programming in idioms from other languages.  ~~Python2 doesn't have closures.~~ **EDIT**: This example was [stolen from here without attribution](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/gotchas/#late-binding-closures) as required by the CC license.\n* 2 is how python does class inheritance and is a reasonable choice for inheritance.  I honestly don't see anything wrong with it, other than that inheritance is done differently elsewhere.  Granted, you should probably not overuse inheritance or mutable class variables if you don't understand it.\n* 9 is just a language change to help the gc.  Py3 is not Py2.  There's no legitimate reason to use an except outside of its clause, so python3 deletes the exception outside of the clause to help the GC free memory (if it references large things).  This is a contrived example.\n* 8 is fairly obvious.  If you use same name as modules or keywords, yes you will have bad results.

That's because there is no declaration of variables, so when you assign to a variable, Python can't know if you're trying to declare a new local with the same name, or reassign the global name, so it defaults to the former. If you have this:\n\n    x = 'foo'\n    def fn():\n        x = 'bar'\n\nAnd you call `fn()`, it will create a new local named `x` with value `bar`, and not touch the global `x`. Most languages work this way. By contrast:\n\n    x = 'foo'\n    def fn():\n        global x\n        x = 'bar'\n\nWill overwrite the global `x` with the value `bar`. Most languages that don't have explicit variable declarations have no way to do this. In your examples:\n\n* `foo1()` is trying to do `x = x + [3]` without declaring `x` as global. Python assumes `x` must be a local, and can't read from it (you tried to add `x` and `[3]`, but there is no local named `x` yet, so you get an error about trying to read `x` before it's been written)\n* `foo2()` is calling a method on `x`, which is fine, so it works\n* `foo3()` is trying to do `x = x + [3]`, without declaring `x` as global. Python assumes `x` must be a local, and there is indeed a local named `x` -- you passed it as a parameter. So that's the variable that gets changed; the global has nothing to do with it\n* `foo4()` is the same as `foo3()`, but you did `x = [3]` instead of `x = x + [3]`\n\nIt would be possible to change the default behavior and say \"all writes overwrite global variables by default\", but now there's no way to make new locals; if you have a local variable, and someday somebody adds a global with the same name, suddenly that local isn't local anymore.

Note `foo1` (and foo2) will work if you add `global x` to explicitly say yes, I want `x` to be the global `x` so I can mutate it.\n\nWhy does your foo2 work?  The fact that python lets you reference top-level function (but not assign to) is quite useful.  E.g., its what's at work when you do\n\n     import requests\n    \n     def some_function():\n         requests.get('http://www.reddit.com')\n\nThat is `import requests` sets a top-level variable as `requests` and then you later can use it inside functions without explicitly passing it in, and even call methods defined within it.  It does make sense that methods called in this way may in some cases mutate their own state, its the programmers responsibility not to lead to evil use of mutable global state.\n\n---\n\nI do agree that `foo3` is a bit confusing, but again if you used the code in a sane way -- `x = foo3(x)` and `x = foo4(x)` you wouldn't have any ambiguity.\n\nThe problem is that python passes by reference and when it can will mutate existing objects. \n\n    In [1]: x = []\n    \n    In [2]: id(x)  # memory location of x\n    Out[2]: 4352851336\n    \n    In [3]: x.append(1)\n    \n    In [4]: id(x)  # memory location hasn't changed\n    Out[4]: 4352851336\n    \n    In [5]: x += [5] # memory location hasn't changed\n    \n    In [6]: id(x)\n    Out[6]: 4352851336\n    \n    In [7]: x = x + [5]     \n\n    In [8]: id(x)# memory location *has* changed; \n    #assignment creates a new list, can't be done in place.\n    Out[8]: 4352848888\n\nIt is good that python does pass by reference than by value when passing objects like lists into functions; otherwise dealing with large objects would get unmanageable.

Once this is done a function object is created with all that information and placed in the scope in which the function was defined. In this case that would be the module (Python speak for a file, basically).\n\nThe next line that gets executed will be \"func(1)\".

Since in this example we're working on module level local and global are identical. \nPython will find the function object that got defined above and call it with the provided arguments. Since we didn't provide a value for the second argument `b` the default value will be filled in. In this case the default value is the list object that got instantiated above when the function was defined.

That being the case it seems to me that the scoping rules are very counter-intuitive - the lifetime of a default argument extends beyond a single call?\n\nThe only other language I know that allows for default arguments is ruby and it mirrors the (sane) behaviour of PHP, with the lifetime of an array being the duration of a single function call:\n\n    def foo(bar=[])\n        bar.push('baz')\n\n        return bar\n    end\n\n    p foo\n\n    p foo\n\n    p foo\n\nTo be honest I can't think of a reason *why* pythons behavior makes more sense than that in ruby / php other unless there is some aspect of python's semantics that i'm not aware of.\n\nEdit: In response to your other post PHP doesn't allow for any expression that needs to be evaluated to be a default parameter, similarly disallow the use of arithmetic operations, new etc. The equivalent to the articles code in PHP would look like:\n\n    function foo($bar = []) {\n        $bar[] = 'baz';\n        return $bar;\n    }\n\n    print_r(foo());\n\n    print_r(foo());\n\n    print_r(foo());\n\n", "id": "chdwp5f", "parent": "t1_chdv1tb", "vote": 1}, {"content": "Good programmers, IMO, follow good software engineering practices.

Here is the issue. I have a data set in CSV format downloaded from Tableau. I need to evaluate each row of the table and assign a letter to the row (A, B, C, or D) based on performance of a single field. I'm using pandas as pd in the below examples.\n\nI've broken out the steps as follows:\n\n1. Import the data into a dataframe\n2. Calculate the quantiles based on the variable in question\n3. Create a new column in the dataframe for performance letter\n4. Fill new column based on evaluation of the kpi\n\nNow, I've managed to successfully do 1 and 2 here:\n\n    df = pd.read_csv('file path', na_values = '')\n    cl_c = df.CR.quantile([0.25])\n    cl_b = df.CR.quantile([0.5])\n    cl_a = df.CR.quantile([0.75])\n\nNow, where I am getting stuck is trying to use the cl\\_\\[letter\\] variables I created to evaluate df\\[CR\\]. I've tried working within the dataframe using a couple of different approaches. One that I attempted was as follows:\n\n    df.loc[df['CR'] >= cl_a, 'Cluster'] = 'A'\n    df.loc[df['CR'] >= cl_b, 'Cluster'] = 'B'\n    df.loc[df['CR'] >= cl_c, 'Cluster'] = 'C'\n    df.loc[df['CR'] < cl_c, 'Cluster'] = 'D'\n\nThe problem here is that I could get it to work if I used the actual value of cl\\_c. But not passing it as a variable. I got the following error: \"ValueError: Can only compare identically-labeled Series objects\".\n\nWhen I just put in the values, it defaulted to C and D. This makes sense because each test would run per row, in order. I could reverse the order, which would probably make it work, but I'm still working with the values instead of variables:\n\n    df.loc[df['CR'] >= 0.20, 'Cluster'] = 'A' \n    df.loc[df['CR'] >= 0.15, 'Cluster'] = 'B' \n    df.loc[df['CR'] >= 0.10, 'Cluster'] = 'C' \n    df.loc[df['CR'] < 0.10, 'Cluster'] = 'D'\n\nAs an example. So I continued research and some people said working with loops in dataframes isn't encouraged. So I wanted to pull out CR as a list, and then create a loop that would create a new list based on conditions in CR:\n\n    x_cr = df['CR'] \n    x_cl = [] \n    \n    for i in x_cr: \n        if (x_cr >= cl_a): \n            x_cl = \"A\" \n        elif (x_cr >= cl_b):  \n            x_cl = \"B\" \n        elif (x_cr >= cl_c): \n            x_cl = \"C\" \n        else (x_cr < cl_c): \n            x_cl = \"D\"\n\nBut I keep getting the same error I was getting above. What am I missing and how do I do this? In both Excel and SPSS I could get this automated and done with about ten minutes worth of work. I'm assuming that if I knew what I was doing in Python I could do the same!\n\nSo how do I test the value of CR (either as a list or within the dataframe) with the quantile value to assign a letter back?", "id": "ff3qkg3", "parent": "t3_er4ux7", "vote": 1}, {"content": "I have a list of names and domains in csv.\n\nI have some python code I that can take them and ping a server to see if it is deliverable.\n\nI want to take the entire list, run this code and add a new column giving the result of my ping.\n\nhere is my code (credit [https://www.scottbrady91.com/Email-Verification/Python-Email-Verification-Script](https://www.scottbrady91.com/Email-Verification/Python-Email-Verification-Script))\n\n(as a caveat, I am NOT making spam, these are customer lists for a client that is getting back into a line of business that was abandoned and he wanted to send a mass mail merge but I cautioned him against sending 1000+ emails that may or may not be deliverable anymore)\n\n    first_name = 'fname'\n    last_name = 'lname'\n    domain_name = 'domain.com'\n    \n    import re\n    \n    addressToVerify =first_name + '.' + last_name + '@' + domain_name\n    match = re.match('^[_a-z0-9-]+(\\.[_a-z0-9-]+)*@[a-z0-9-]+(\\.[a-z0-9-]+)*(\\.[a-z]{2,4})$', addressToVerify)\n    \n    if match == None:\n    \tprint('Bad Syntax')\n    \traise ValueError('Bad Syntax')\n    \n    import dns.resolver\n    \n    records = dns.resolver.query(domain_name,'MX')\n    mxRecord = records[0].exchange\n    mxRecord = str(mxRecord)\n    \n    import socket\n    import smtplib\n    \n    # Get local server hostname\n    host = socket.gethostname()\n    \n    # SMTP lib setup (use debug level for full output)\n    server = smtplib.SMTP()\n    server.set_debuglevel(0)\n    \n    # SMTP Conversation\n    server.connect(mxRecord)\n    server.helo(host)\n    server.mail(addressToVerify)\n    code, message = server.rcpt(str(addressToVerify))\n    server.quit()\n    \n    # Assume 250 as Success\n    if code == 250:\n    \tprint('Success')\n    else:\n    \tprint('Bad')\n\nmy data is a simple first name, last name, domain .csv and if it makes things simpler, I can grab the old email addresses instead and just use that.\n\nI am having trouble getting what I need in a straightforward way and I know I am a few weeks away in my Python training from getting to this place naturally.", "id": "ff3ydjz", "parent": "t3_er4ux7", "vote": 1}, {"content": "I have a pandas question.

Obviously, trying to say \"Look at line X and compare CR to this whole dataframe\" wasn't going to work.\n3. However, because it WAS a dataframe, I could still point to a specific component of it to get my float!\n4. So I just had to use cl\\_c.at\\[0.25\\] as the quantile was the name of the row that the dataframe created!\n\nSo this:\n\n    df.loc[df['CR'] < cl_c, 'Cluster'] = 'D'\n\nBecame this:\n\n    df.loc[df['CR'] < cl_c.at[0.25], 'Cluster'] = 'D'\n\nAnd it worked!\n\nNow, this wasn't super efficient, so I'm going to change it so all the quantiles are in a single dataframe (which I'll call \"clusters\") and then the point will just be to each data point instead of an individual dataframe. \n\nI'm very excited because my program worked!

This operates on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. You can also set a maximum number of items to hold in the queue.\n\nThe arguments there are important. If you call `get` on a queue, by default it will block until it gets an item, waiting till one is inserted if it is empty. Similarly if you try to insert an item into a full queue it will block until another item is removed, making space for it.\n\nThe whole `queue` design is based around multithreading considerations, so you are better off looking at that if you want to understand them better.\n\nThe limitations on interactions also allow optimisations when all you don't need all the functionality of a more flexible list. There I'd suggest looking at [`deque`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.deque) from the `collections module.
