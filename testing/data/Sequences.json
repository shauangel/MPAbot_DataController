They make your code really hard to debug, because they increase the interactions between different parts of code, and you wind up trying to figure out what's altering the global variable, and where, and when, and why, instead of tracing well-defined interactions between different well-defined functions. If you *can* pass necessary information from function to function instead of storing it in a global variable, you almost always should. The few minutes you have to spend rethinking your code now can save you hours of debugging later. Try not to use global variables if you can avoid it.\n\nThat being said, there are sometimes good reasons to use global variables, and, to answer the question that you actually asked, **yes, you can tell `function_1()` to modify the global variable `x` instead of the local variable `x`** by using the `global` declaration:\n\n    def function_1():\n        global x\n        x = 10\n        print(\"(function_1) x = \", x)\n\nDeclaring the function to be `global` means that Python will not create a new local variable called `x` that shadows (prevents you from seeing) the global variable `x`. You need to make the declaration before you assign anything to the variable. There are languages where you can do things like `global x = 10` in one line, but that's not valid syntax in Python. When you need to use global variables, the smart thing to do is just to declare all of them immediately at the top of the function, so you don't forget; this also helps the reader of your code (say, you, when you come back to fix something in six months) remember that you are in fact dealing with global variables here so as to avoid confusion.\n\nYou can also sometimes get away without using the `global` declaration, but the set of circumstances in which that works is a little baroque and easy to break if you move code around, plus it makes your own code harder to read for you down the road by obscuring the fact that you're dealing with global variables, so just always making the declaration is a good move.", "id": "fp7k5yw", "parent": "t1_fp4dd2t", "vote": 1}, {"content": " > something like the following considered good practice?\n\nYes.  The number of lines in a function isn't the main concern, it's what the function does and how easy it is to understand that matters.  A long function, say more than 50 or 100 lines, might be considered too long and would be rewritten as shorter code calling sub-functions.\n\nAs an example, let's look at how you would approach writing a program to perform lots of different analyses on various text files.  This is a long post, but there's quite a bit to this subject.\n\nThe basic idea of your code is to read a file, extract lines in a certain range of line numbers and perform different analyses on those extracted lines.  You start by writing code to process just one file in a fixed number of ways.  This is just to get started and experiment with ideas.\n\nOnce you have that experimental code running and debugged you start to refactor.  You write a function that takes a filename and a tuple of start+stop line numbers and returns the required lines.  Why would you do that? There are two reasons.  First, replacing the file reading code in your \"mainline\" code simplifies your mainline code.  All the complexity of reading the file is replaced by a simple function call that returns a list of lines.  It's almost like you extended the python language with one line replacing multiple lines that really had nothing to do with the mainline task - processing the file.  The complexity of reading the file is hidden away allowing your mainline code to focus on its task.  Second, by making a function to read a range of lines from a file you have a function that you can easily test.  It's very hard to test 1000 lines of monolithic code and get more than just \"it works\" or \"it doesn't work\".  It's more helpful if you can test small parts because any bugs you find are easier to fix.  Having two or more interacting bugs in a large body of monolithic code is a nightmare, trust me.\n\nNext you refactor the main code that handles one file.  You put all that into one function that processes a single file.  This function would take parameters such as the file to process and where to write the results.  That function would be called by *new* main code that would get a list of files from somewhere, perhaps a file, and would call the \"process file\" function for each file.\n\nThen you put the code that does the analysis of the file's lines into its own function.  You do this because one of the requirements, which you have ignored to this point, is to perform different analyses on different files.  In fact, you might have to perform a different number of analyses on each file, so you change the processing function to accept a list of functions that you will analyse the text with.  Each analysis will be performed by its own function, and the main code will decide which functions to pass to the processing function.  Of course, its easy to test each analysis function.\n\nAll the time you are writing code you would be on the lookout for *repeated* blocks of code that you could replace with a call to a new function.  If you find a function becomes too large to be easily understood you look for ways to simplify the function by moving chunks of code performing one logical operation into their own function.  The aim is to reduce the complexity of a body of code and make it more understandable.\n\nNote how much easier it is to add a new analysis function to the code.  All you have to do is write the new function, test it, and modify the main code to recognize when the new function should be used and pass a reference to the function to the \"process the file\" function.  Proper use of functions makes it easier to extend and modify your program.\n\nOf course, once you have some experience you would probably start out by writing functions that you knew you would need, but even then you will be on the lookout for duplicated code that you could convert into a function.", "id": "for0y4y", "parent": "t1_foqh540", "vote": 3}, {"content": "It sounds like you are working on some sort of GUI or perhaps a game, I only did the intro to python and stop for a couple of months, looking to restart again.

Not necessary for you to learn **everything** yourself, if you work in a (good) team.\n\n- **(2)** Automated testing. Pytest, or at the very least Django's test framework. [Obey the Testing Goat!](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com)\n- **(4)** Basic Linux administration. Needed for deployment on a VPS (cheaper). You can install Ubuntu (Or Kubuntu, because KDE is the best looking DE - yes, this comment is opinionated) for free on your machine, or in Virtualbox. I recommend installing it on your development machine - it makes dealing with Docker much simpler, you will be closer to your deployment environment, and you will learn a lot more.\n- **(5)** Git source code management. https://www.gitlab.com is awesome, GitHub is more popular for some reason. They both allow you to host git repositories for free. Use it to keep track of your software changes, so if you break your app, you can easily roll back to a previous version, and to backup your code on gitlab or github (keep *other* backups).\n- **(2)** Docker containers. Part of Devops. Allows you to easily generate containers with Django, Node for the Front-end, Databases you use, etc. without having to install them locally.\n- **(3)** Databases. Don't just rely on the Django ORM... There are plenty of other options, such as MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j, etc. You should at the very least learn PostgreSQL, the best DB to use with Django. Mongo can wait. Neo4j is for graphs (you can learn graph theory, but that's not strictly necessary - however, it is fun). (Note: not saying Django and Mongo play well together... In fact, the few projects that tried joining them are abandoned. If you need JSON, use Postgres' JSON field. If you want to play with Mongo, try Flask.)\n- **(2)** Devops ( /r/devops ) - automated testing, automated deployment\n- **(1.5)** Alternatively (or also) to Linux, cloud deployments: Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Azure... It doesn't hurt to have at least basic knowledge - often listed as a plus on job posts.\n- **(5)** HTML / JavaScript / CSS. The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a great resource. You need to learn web technologies to develop websites.\n- **(4)** One or more CSS frameworks, so you don't have to code pages from scratch. Vuetify (if you learn Vue.js), Bootstrap, Foundation by Zurb, Materialize CSS (if you like Google's Material Design specs), etc.\n- **(2)** Optionally, JavaScript frameworks for Single Page Applications, and Progressive Web Apps. Vue.js with Nuxt.js is simple enough, once you learned JS. (Yes, still opinionated. React is ugly with its JSX syntax. Angular 2 might be worth a look, but I don't have time to waste on that right now.)\n- **(2)** If you go with SPAs, Django-Rest-Framework (DRF) to generate REST APIs. You can also learn Graphene and go with GraphQL instead of REST, but that is probably overkill. Facebook wrote GraphQL because they needed it, so when your codebase is as large as Facebook's and you hit 2 billion users, you can hire someone who knows GraphQL.\n- **(1)** HTTP protocol. Never a bad thing to know, if you need to troubleshoot a server.\n- **(5)** SSL. Let's Encrypt. Security matters.\n- **(1)** DNS. No need to deploy BIND yourself, but knowing how to edit zone files for a domain you own certainly helps.\n- **(1)** Everything about TCP/IP and Networking.\n- **(3)** Flask, Tornado, etc. alternatives to Django. Lighter, better suited for some situations.\n\nYes, this is a very long list. Some of it is less necessary than other stuff. Don't get discouraged. I ordered it in the order you ideally *would* want to learn all that, but since writing code is also important, I also put a ranking of how important I feel it *really* is to know - **(1)** is lowest, **(5)** is highest.\n\nEdit: The reason I wrote it like this, is because it fits my workflow, which is:\n\n- Setup Linux + Docker (step 0 - usually already done)\n- Create a folder for my project; add it to git\n- Start a Docker container with PostGIS\n- Start a Docker container for Django+dependencies\n- Start a Docker container for front-end\n- Develop / run project locally\n- Automate deployment\n- Deploy to the net.", "id": "elgw9ma", "parent": "t1_elgsvn0", "vote": 4}, {"content": "What are suffix trees?", "id": "elgyvbh", "parent": "t1_elgvwmi", "vote": 1}, {"content": "Building stuff is awesome, but the REPL is also amazing, and incredibly powerful.

So, here it is:\n\n    import random\n    secret = random.randrange(1, 100)\n    guess = input(\"Guess a number between 1 and 99: \")\n    number = int(guess)\n    while number != secret:\n        print(\"You guessed wrong. :(\")\n        if number > secret:\n            guess1 = input(\"Please guess lower, this time: \")\n            number = int(guess1)\n        else:\n            guess1 = input(\"Please guess higher, this time: \")\n            number = int(guess1)\n    print(\"You guessed the secret number of \" + str(secret) + \"!!!\")\n\nMy question revolves around my use of the 'guess' and 'guess1' variables. You have to define 'number' before the while loop because that variable is used to define the circumstances of the loop. But if you redefine 'number' within the while loop, the code breaks.

We don't write code or solve homework questions here for you, but we can suggest approachs to solving a problem.\n\nThe way to solve a problem like this if you aren't proficient with python is to look at what is asked, in small pieces, and cross off any solutions that don't match the question piece.  The first piece is \"define a function called upper_slice\".  So look at all of the options and cross off any that don't mention \"upper_slice\".  Skip option `d` because that's the \"none of the above\" option.\n\nOnce you've done that (hint, nothing was crossed off unfortunately) you get the next piece of the question: \"which takes in a string and an integer as arguments\".  Mark off any options that don't pass 2 parameters.  You **can** cross off one now!\n\nThe next piece is implicit in the previous part \"a string and an integer\".  You want to see if the parameter names hint at the type of data passed.  This doesn't help much as all the options (apart from `d`) pass `text` and `number` which is what you might expect.\n\nThe next part is \"returns the string slice\".  You can cross off any functions that don't do a `return`.\n\nAnd so on.  At the end you have to know some python to remove the remaining options that don't obey the sample input and output examples you are given.\n\nAt the end if you are left with only `d` then that's the answer.  If there's any other single option remaining then **that's** the answer.\n\nIf you know python well enough, of course, you can first look at the options and remove any that aren't legal python, like those that use incorrect keywords, for example.", "id": "haifcc9", "parent": "t1_hah4aig", "vote": 2}, {"content": "Have you tried running the code in the python interpreter to **see** what happens?", "id": "haig4xv", "parent": "t1_hah0jpr", "vote": 1}, {"content": "Have you tried running the code in the python interpreter to **see** what happens?", "id": "haig0o7", "parent": "t1_hah0o8f", "vote": 1}, {"content": "They are totally different things.

So in the first example the `Child` class inherits from `Parent` and defines its own `__init__()` method which also doesn't do anything.

So json can take a wide range of python variables (string, tuple, list, dictionary, etc) and converts them into a string form.  That string may be written to a file, sent to another computer somehow, etc.  The value of doing this is that it's possible to take the json string and convert it back to a python object, like this:\n\n    import json\n    data = [{'a': 'A', 'b': (2, 4), 'c': 3.0}]\n    data_string = json.dumps(data)\n    print('JSON:', data_string)\n    print(type(data_string))\n\n    new_data = json.loads(data_string)    # convert JSON string back to python object\n    print(' NEW:', new_data)    \n    print(type(new_data))\n\nWhen we run this we see this printed:\n\n    JSON: [{\"a\": \"A\", \"b\": [2, 4], \"c\": 3.0}]\n    <class 'str'>\n     NEW: [{'a': 'A', 'b': [2, 4], 'c': 3.0}]\n    <class 'list'>\n\nNote the line starting \"NEW\".  This prints a list (as the last line shows) that is identical (more or less) to the list containing a dictionary that we started with.\n\nSo using json you can convert python objects to text strings and reconstruct the python objects from the string.  This process is called serialization.  Other modules that serialize, but in different ways, are pickle and shelve.\n\nOne use for serialization is if you have a game and when the user quits mid-game you might want to allow the user to restart at the point where they quit.  You can do that by serializing some python objects that describe the game state and writing that serialized string data to a file before actually quitting the game.  When the game runs again you read the file, convert the serialized string data back to python objects and continue the game at the point where the user quit the previous time.", "id": "h9zw74t", "parent": "t1_h9zn2dx", "vote": 3}, {"content": "> I should focus on how to properly implement the class variables?\n\nI don't have much use for class variables.

If you try to change the value of a class variable with `self.x = 42` then you actually create a new instance variable and the class variable is unchanged.

If you want to go in and add another step of the pipeline, your version control software will think you modified two lines, instead of just one, because you have to add the `\\` to the last line. This can make diffs slightly harder to read.\n\nOf course, you can ensure every line (including the last one) has a `\\` to escape the newline, avoiding this problem, but then you're forced to ensure that the next line after it is a blank line, which is somewhat confusing and error prone.\n\nAlso, if you are going to use line continuations repeatedly like that, many people would be very tempted to make sure all the backslashes line up neatly.

I'm still learning both and I just need a push in the right direction on what method to use so I can work through it and learn.\n\nSay I have a series of 5 processes in a manufacturing facility, each process represented by a column. Occasionally a downstream process (column 5) gets backed up and slows down upstream processes (column 4, then 3, etc). I have a 2D array that indicates running(0) or backed up(1). Each column is an individual process and each row is a time interval. The array will be the same size every time (10000+ rows, 5 columns), but the values change. Example:\n\n>\n>MyArray = \n>\n>                [0 0 0 0 0\n>          \n>                 0 1 0 0 0\n>           \n>                 1 1 0 0 1\n>           \n>                 1 0 0 0 1\n>           \n>                 0 0 0 1 1\n>           \n>                 0 0 1 1 1\n>           \n>                 0 0 1 1 0\n>           \n>                 0 1 1 0 0\n>           \n>                 0 1 0 0 0\n>           \n>                 0 0 0 0 0]\n\n\nEssentially when there is a value of 1, I want to trace it to the upper rightmost adjacent 1. So for column 1, rows 2 & 3 would be traced back to column 2, row 2. For column 2, rows 8 & 9 would be traced back to column 5, row 3. Currently I have just have an if statement looking to the right within the same row and it's better than nothing, but does not capture the cascade effect you get when something backs up multiple upstream processes.\n\nI could figure out a way to do it by looping a search to look up in a column until it finds a zero, then if the next column value is a 1, search up until finds a zero, repeat. But this seems really inefficient and I feel like there has to be a better way to do it. Any kinds of thoughts or comments would be very helpful.

My best guess is that the git repositories were written for previous versions of your packages, and the package people have since made it more picky about types (probably increases performance, at the cost of making programmers work harder). Just a guess though.\n\nIf you're supplying your own inputs to their functions, I suspect that their functions are just very picky about types. That's somewhat nonstandard in python, but sometimes happens when people are trying to eek some performance out of something. Best bet in that case is to look up the documentation for each function you use, and see what type it expects. \n\nIn this case a long is just an integer that takes more room in memory than a normal int does in something like C. Python usually uses it's own special integer type that doesn't care so much (if at all) about things like size in memory when you do something like `x=4`, but that comes at a cost. If this is a performance package, it might not have wanted to pay that cost, and so decided to use integer types that have a fixed memory footprint. So if you are supplying your own inputs, it's possible that you have to specify the type somehow (I'm not familiar with those packages, but in numpy, you'd use numpy.int32(4) numpy.int64(4) instead of 4, or something - though in a perfect world, the functions would handle that conversion for you).\n\nFor sure though, the whole point of example code is that you install the packages, then run the code and it just works. Assuming that you have the correct versions of the packages and all dependencies, and that you're using purely their code, I can't imagine any error on your part that would result in type errors (though sometimes things I can't imagine end up being true).

The function `morse()` takes a single parameter, a string named `text`.  This is the string to convert to morse or convert back to text.\n\nThe next statement defines a dictionary `encrypt` that maps a single character to the morse equivalent string.  This dictionary is used to convert one character (uppercase only) into the equivalent morse string.  This means if we do `encrypt['A']` we get a string `.-`, which is morse code for \"A\".\n\nThe next line \"inverts\" the `encrypt` dictionary.  This changes the key:value pairs in `encrypt` to value:key pairs in `decrypt` dictionary.  This gives us a dictionary which can convert a string of morse back to the character it represents.  So `decrypt['.-']` evaluates to `A`.  Get into the habit when reading code like this to put a print after the line(s) you don't understand and see what is generated.  So add this line after the line that creates `decrypt`:\n\n    print(decrypt)\n\nThe line `if '-' in text:` looks for a `-` character in `text`, which is the string we were given to process.  If the string contains the `-` character we assume that it's morse code and we convert it back to ABCDE...  Otherwise we convert each character to its morse code string.\n\nThe `''.join(l)` thing is a method of a string.  It basically joins each element of list `l` placing the string (before the `.`) between each element of the list.  So if we have `', '.join(['1', '2', '3'])` we would get a string \"1, 2, 3\".", "id": "fyjdc3x", "parent": "t1_fyj7nfq", "vote": 1}, {"content": "I would rather try a strptime per possible format\n\n    from datetime import datetime\n\n    def dt_from_str(s):\n        for parse_str in ['COE until %b %Y',\n                          'COE expiry: %d/%m/%Y',\n                          'COE till  %d/%m/%y',\n                          'COE lasts until %d %B %Y non renewable']:\n            try:\n                return datetime.strptime(s, parse_str)\n            except ValueError:\n                pass\n\n    strings = ['COE until JUL 2029',\n               'COE expiry: 25/12/2010',\n               'COE till 21/12/29',\n               'COE lasts until 21 MARCH 2009 non renewable']\n    for s in strings:\n        dt = dt_from_str(s)\n        print(dt.year, dt.month)", "id": "fyky8z1", "parent": "t1_fyjr6cv", "vote": 1}, {"content": ">the date of the data taken\n\nThose pages have a \"Last Updated\" div; parse that with datetime.strptime.", "id": "fylj0c9", "parent": "t1_fykvy5u", "vote": 1}, {"content": "Start with the plain Jupyter notebook and switch to JupyterLab when you have more than one developer.", "id": "fylhsi1", "parent": "t1_fykwool", "vote": 1}, {"content": "You can test that a word has both upper and lowercase letters:\n\n    >>> def mixed_case(s): return any(c in string.ascii_lowercase for c in s) and any(c in string.ascii_uppercase for c in s)\n    ... \n    >>> mixed_case('abc')\n    False\n    >>> mixed_case('aBc')\n    True\n    >>> import random\n    >>> def shuffled(s):\n    ...     l = list(s)\n    ...     random.shuffle(l)\n    ...     return ''.join(l)\n    ... \n    >>> words = \"The quick Brown fOx jumped\"\n    >>> [shuffled(w) if mixed_case(w) else w for w in words.split()]\n    ['Teh', 'quick', 'onrBw', 'xfO', 'jumped']\n    >>>", "id": "fylhmdp", "parent": "t1_fykxibi", "vote": 1}, {"content": "Tks bro! https://youtu.be/sxTmJE4k0ho\n\nWould you say that this one is a good starting point?

However, I was wondering if it is possible to automate pulling of reports from a website. The website has a login (requires an account), and in order to pull the report, there are also several fields to tick and select, and then, to generate the report, create a file name, and save it to the PC. Thereafter, the report will load, and only then, can you go and click to download the report. Would this be possible to automate? I can share more info if needed for clarity. Not looking for anyone to help or any code, I just want to know the possibility and if there is anything I can find more info on to help with such a project.

I think I understand what it does, but I'm confused when or when not to use them. For example. here:\n\n    from pygame.sprite import Sprite\n    from pygame.sprite import Group\n    ...\n    class Bullet(Sprite):\n        \n        def __init__(self, screen, ship):\n            super().__init__()\n            ...\n        ...\n        def update(self):\n            ...\n    ...\n    def update_bullets(screen, bullets):\n        bullets.update()\n    \n        for bullet in bullets.copy():\n            if bullet.x >= screen.get_rect().width:\n                bullets.remove(bullet)\n                print(len(bullets))\n    ...\n    def run_game():\n        pygame.init()\n        bullets = Group()\n        ...\n        while True:\n            ...\n            for bullet in bullets.sprites():\n                bullet.draw_bullet()\n            ...\n    ...\n\nIf I understand correctly, the `Sprite` superclass allows to iterativly apply the same method to every instance of the `Bullet` subclass, as in `bullets.update()`. This example also requires a special kind of `bullets` list, created as a `Group` instance.\n\nBut then when we decide to loop through the items in the list, two different notations are used: `for bullet in bullets.copy()` and `for bullet in bullets.sprites()`. I understand the necessity of `.copy()` method in the former case, but don't quite grasp the need to use the `.sprite()` method in the latter case. Is it because I actually gotta access the methods of each `Bullet` object in the latter case, rather than just reference an entry on a list as in the former case? Not quite sure. What would change (algorithm-wise) if I were to use `for bullet in bullets.copy().sprites()` in the former case, or `for bullet in bullets` in the latter case?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: I tried both modifications, and everything works the same, so I'm even more startled than before.", "id": "flh2p1b", "parent": "t3_fnabsw", "vote": 1}, {"content": "How come some modules call for an import like:\n\n**from** datetime **import** date, timedelta\n\nBut if I do just :\n\n**import** datetime\n\nI get the error: NameError: name 'date' is not defined\n\nShouldn't the second import method import EVERYTHING including \"date\"?", "id": "flhw2ro", "parent": "t3_fnabsw", "vote": 1}, {"content": "I\u2019m thinking of learning python.

Serving a beautiful website to a robot is a waste of resources for the people that own the website, so if there are enough people that want robotic access the website will make a robot-friendly version of the pages. In reddit, for example, you can add \".json\" to the end of any url and get the robot version, designed for easy parsing. \n\nNo API? Ok next you dig into the html source code. If it's a simple webpage then it will have some kind of structured request that includes the login information and the search parameters. You can recreate that call in python and get the html back, which you would then parse with beautifulsoup. \n\nOh no, after digging into html you find out it's one of the new fancy websites that's dynamically loaded with JS? Ok, then you dig into the JS. It must be getting the data from somewhere. Find out what calls the JS is making and recreate them with python. The result will be some kind of serialization, which may be easy to parse if it's a standard like json or xml, or it may not be ... \n\nOhbother, the JS calls are encrypted or otherwise too hard to track? As a last resort you can remote control your browser.

My plotting code is\n\n`om_ax = 2*np.pi * np.fft.fftshift( np.fft.fftfreq(Nt,d=Deltat) )`  \n`k_ax  = 2*np.pi * np.fft.fftshift( np.fft.fftfreq(Nx,d=dx) )`  \n`log_komega_spec = np.log(komega_spec)`  \n`extnt=[k_ax[0], k_ax[-1] , om_ax[0], om_ax[-1] ]`  \n`fig, ax = plt.subplots()`  \n`im = plt.imshow(log_komega_spec, extent=extnt , aspect='auto')`\n\nI know this because I know that the parabola in the image has to be oriented in the way that it is, please see [the question on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68699800/displaying-a-spatio-temporal-spectrum-with-imshow-what-order-are-the-frequencie) (Ignore the y-axis tick lables, this is because I used the `extent` kwarg, which brute forces the axis labelling but as far as I know doesn't do anything to the actual array).  \n\n\nSo my question is: where should the negative frequencies be after an fft and fftshift, and why is my array upside-down?\n\nThanks!", "id": "h8bmrau", "parent": "t3_p0q0m2", "vote": 1}, {"content": "Hey guys,\n\nI got a nice beginner question:\n\nSo I have two dataframes that I'm reading in via exel sheets.

Same code as above just named the new dataframe 'ndf'.\n\nNow I would like to merge them. without reimporting already containing tickets/rows.\n\nWhen I tried the df.join or df.merge class, I couldn't get it to work. I also don't understand the pandas API reference online. I guess I'm too new to Python or programming to understand.\n\nOr is there no pandas class that does what I want (checking if the index is already there and then only to add unique ones.)\n\nI hope this is understandable.\n\nThank you!", "id": "h8c16ng", "parent": "t3_p0q0m2", "vote": 1}, {"content": "I have a lot of trouble with environments.

You could do what you're doing if it works, but you could probably simplify it down a bit. \n\nFirst thing, lets make it lowercase, so you can keep your first line of code. \n\nAfter this, you need to define the rules of your grammar. What do you want to keep? That would probably be easier than defining everything you want to remove. So lets say you want to keep all lowercase letters, and all whitespace (you want to keep the whitespace since it's what separates each word). You can then write a simple regular expression to remove anything that isn't a lowercase letter or whitespace, like this:\n\n    re.sub(r'[^a-z\\s]', '', s)\n\nThe `^` at the beginning of the set will negate the set, and therefore match anything *not* in the set, which is then replaced with nothing.

Asking a separate program to then play your video, and to proceed to the next video when it's done, is hard and annoying to set up.

Other solutions will be more clunky: you could use firefox to open your youtube URLs but it won't be able to tell you when the video is finished playing. \n\nI love the idea, you've clearly got a drive for this.

If you're using linux, you probably know this already.\n\nShell can be a bunch of things, but in the context of python, you're probably hearing about a \"python shell\" in particular. A python shell is a prompt where you can type python code one (or a small number of) line(s) at a time, and have it run. This is awesome for testing out code snippets (eg, I never remember whether it's `f\"{1231:,7}\"` or `f\"{1231:7,}\"` and I can test just that easily in a shell). The standard way of opening a python shell is to open an operating system command line and type the word \"python\" - assuming you've added python to your path on install. If not, you'd have to type the full path to your python interpreter (see a bit later), or add python to your path. (Your path is where your operating system looks for programs when you type things like \"python\" on the command line, so that it know what to do.)\n\nIPython is a fancier python shell. (It might have other features as well, but that's all I use it for.) It's better in every way. To use it (assuming python is on your path), type \"pip install ipython\", then \"ipython\".\n\nThe (a) python interpreter is particular computer program that takes the code you've written in python, figures out what it means, and does it. The standard way to get one is to download it from python.org. \n\nPython packages are groups of python code that you can use. A bunch are included with the basic python interpreter, others (numpy, sklearn, pandas) are not, but are very easy to get - type `pip install packagename`.\n\nAnaconda is a differently packaged python interpreter that comes with a lot of data sciencey packages with it. A lot of data scientists like it for this reason. I personally dislike it, because it introduces a few quirks (conda isntall vs pip install) and I've yet to run into a package I care about that I can't get from pip. I, personally, recommend against it, but others will disagree.\n\nJupyter notebooks are a particular way of displaying and running your code.

In Python, everything, at a deep level, is an *object* in the sense that object-oriented programming uses that word. So, for instance, you can define new kinds (classes) of objects yourself:\n\n    class Pumpkin:\n        def __init__(self, diameter, height, weight, color, picture):\n            self.diameter = diameter\n            self.height = height\n            self.weight = weight\n            self.color = color\n            self.picture = picture\n\n        def display_picture(self):\n            # do whatever's necessary to pop up a picture on screen or insert it into the web page currently being written, or whatever ...\n\nThis gets you a kind of object called `Pumpkin`, and has a method for setting up individual pumpkins to track their height, weight, diameter, and color, and that might be handy if you are, for instance, a vendor of fine artisanal pumpkins: you can create a new `Pumpkin` object by saying something like `big_pumpkin = Pumpkin(32, 18, 44, 'orange', 'img/big_orange_pumpkin.jpg')` and you will now have a `Pumpkin` object tracking the attributes of that individual pumpkin. You can create as many of these objects as you want and store them in lists or dictionaries or pass them around as parameters to your other functions that deal with your pumpkin inventory. You can read back the individual attributes of your `Pumpkin` object by using expressions like `big_pumpkin.color`, which will return `\"orange\"`. Within the individual methods (including `__init__()`, whose name format should signal to you that it is \"magically\" called when a new object is created), the `self` parameter refers to the particular individual `Pumpkin` that the code is dealing with at that moment. You can have many of these objects, and you can examine their attributes individually, or put them in a list or other structure and iterate over them to look at the attributes aof all of them one at a time and compute, say, an average diameter or weight for all pumpkins you currently have in stock.\n\nObjects can also have *methods* that operate on them in various ways, and one of the things that makes objects useful in the first place is that the methods operate on a bundle of data that \"hangs together\" as a single thing, so you don't have to keep track of multiple attributes separately and remember to pass them together. So the `Pumpkin` class has a method, `display_picture`, that can be called to do whatever `display_picture` is supposed to do: pop up a picture on screen, insert it into a page of a website, or whatever's appropriate for what the program is supposed to be doing. You can invoke that method on an individual `Pumpkin` with an expression like `big_pumpkin.display_picture()`.\n\nWhat's relevant is that built-in data types are *also* objects and also have methods that operate on their stored data. So, for instance, strings have methods like `.upper()` (to produce a new string that's an upper-case version of an existing string) or `.replace()` (to produce a new string that replaces some characters in the old string with new characters) or `.isalpha()` to tell you if the string contains only alphabetic characters. Numbers have different methods that deal with them: there's no such thing as an upper-case number, so they don't have an `.upper()` method. You can see what methods are defined for an object type by passing the type name or an instance of the type to the `dir()` function: try `dir('hello')` or `dir(str)` or `dir(int)` for examples.\n\n\"Everything is an object\" is probably the single biggest unifying idea in Python, and you'll have small-scale realizations about it as you continue learning. Having a unifying concept (the `object` type) at the top of the type hierarchy makes all kinds of things possible and structures the language in specific ways, some of which might seem weird if you're coming to Python from other languages that make other assumptions.\n\nIf what you're really wondering is something along the lines of \"why is `len()` a built-in function, whereas `.isalpha()` is a method on the string class?,\" the answer is that `len()` works on many many different kinds of things -- strings have a `len()`, but so do lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc. etc. etc. -- whereas defining `.isalpha()` on virtually anything that's not a string would be nonsensical, or would result in trivial falsity for virtually everything other than strings, whichever way you prefer to look at it. So `.isalpha()` is only defined on the string class, not as a built-in function. But it makes sense to take the `len()` of a lot of things, so it's a built-in function rather than being the method of many different classes.\n\nIf what you're really asking is \"can I add a method to a class from outside its definition in a `class` statement, well, yes, you can do that too:\n\n    def explode(self):\n        # do whatever Pumpkin-exploding behavior is necessary\n    \n    Pumpkin.explode = explode\n\n... and you've now got an `.explode()` method on all `Pumpkin` objects in your program, even the ones you already created before you modified the class definition. This behavior is *silly*, and arguably a *bad idea* in most circumstances, but it can be done and is in some cases the only way to accomplish something.\n\nDoes that make sense?

But the star-unpacking method comes in handy in other circumstances, and sometimes it's the more appropriate or flexible option. Notably, if you have a list or a tuple, you can unpack it directly into the positional arguments of a function:\n\n    args = ('hello ', 3, True)\n    \n    def say_it(what, num_times, line_break_after):\n        print(what * num_times)\n        if line_break_after:\n            print()\n\n    say_it(*args)\n\nThis is a silly or trivial example, but it becomes useful in more complex situations: maybe you're shipping tupples of arguments across a network to be executed on another machine. Maybe an API you're communicating with ships you a list of data that you want to pass to a function and that's the easiest way to do it. Maybe you want to have a threaded application waiting to get lists of arguments off of a queue that's filled by another thread. Maybe the actual function that's going to be called is configured based on some complex logic that's determined at runtime, and so is the data that's passed to it; in that case, being able to say \"just expand this list of arguments\" is super-helpful. It's hard to show the utility of the syntax in five lines, but it comes in handy all the time to avoid fifty lines' worth of work in larger systems.\n\nAnother useful trick that comes in handy: you can use the double-star syntax to unpack *dictionaries* to **keyword arguments**, which is much more frequently useful, IMHO.

I wrote a longer answer because I didn't have time to write a shorter one.\n\nPlenty of people use the terms inexactly, but. Technically methods are a specific kind of function: the kind of function that that takes an instance argument (the `self` parameter) to refer to an object that the method is itself bound to. (In Python 2.X, it was possible to create \"unbound methods\" that were different from being a simple function, but that is no longer the case because the underlying wiring works differently now. This is a footnote anyway; you'll likely not ever have to care enough about Python 2 to need to know that, and that's still true even if you wind up working with Python 2 a moderate amount.) So if a function isn't defined in the context of a class definition, and you're not \"monkey patching\" it on -- attaching it to a class definition later on -- it's not technically \"a method.\" (Though, again, a lot of times people use the terms inexactly.)\n\nHere's a quick syntactical overview:\n\n    def this_is_a_function(a, b):\n        print(a + b)\n    \n    class aClass:\n        def this_is_a_method(self, a, b)\n        self.a, self.b = a, b\n        print(a + b)\n\nThey don't do exactly the same thing -- `aClass.this_is_a_method()` also stores the parameters `a` and `b` on the instance, `self`, before doing anything with them, whereas `this_is_a_function()` uses them, prints their sum, and then they evaporate forever -- but they print the same thing to the screen. `this_is_a_method()` is a method specifically because it occurs as part of the definition of a class, and it therefore gets the `self` parameter that provides access to its instance data; `this_is_a_function()` is a simple function specifically because it doesn't occur as part of a class definition, and therefore *isn't* attached to a `self` instance. \n\nA method is also a kind of a function, though; it's a specific kind that's tied to a class (and, in practice, usually to instances); but not all functions are methods. You'll sometimes see the phrase \"simple function\" being used specifically to mean a function that's not a method. And, again, people frequently speak inexactly about these things.

Python lets you make multiple assignments on a single line, if you want, with commas:\n\n    x, y, z = 1, 4, 7.3\n\nThe variables need not be of the same type:\n\n    index, finished, error = 1, False, None\n\nand this is a common way to set up initial values of variables. What you're actually doing, syntactically, us using tuples on both sides of the equals sign, so that last example is equivalent to writing this, which makes it more explicit:\n\n    (index, finished, error) = (1, False, None)\n\nThis means that you can also unpack a tuple (or list) you've obtained some other way into a set of variables if you're using the same number of variables as the tuple has elements:\n\n    a_tuple = (1, 9, 7.1)\n    g, h, i = a_tuple\n\nThat was a silly example -- you might as well just collapse those two lines into one and save yourself from assigning to an intermediate variable -- but you can imagine how it might be helpful if the tuple contains data supplied by another process or laboriously built up by some elaborate computation. (It's possible to also do the unpacking to a number of variables that don't match the number of items in the tuple or list, which might be handy if you don't know in advance how many items will be in it, but that's a more complex syntax that I'll leave to the side for now.)\n\nSomething that might be surprising to you if you have experience with lower-level languages is that functions can also *return* multiple values easily, which also involves actually returning a tuple:\n\n    def count_lines_in_file(file_path):\n        error, result = None, 1\n        with open(file_path) as the_text_file:\n            try:\n                for line in the_text_file:\n                    result += 1\n            except IOError as errrr:\n                error = errrr\n        return error, result\n\nYou can then just use tuple unpacking to get both values at once from the function:\n\n    error, num_lines = count_lines_in_file('Moby Dick.txt')\n\n... and getting a non-`None` error would mean that something went wrong and the line count is probably off.\n\nBy the way, if you're assigning the same value to a bunch of variables, you can also do this:\n\n    a = b = c = d = e = f = g = h = i = j = 0\n\nAs for the dot notation. Objects can have \"instance attributes\" -- bits of data that are parts of the objects themselves. This is part of the point of objects in the first place: they become little bundles of data that's all packaged together, along with methods to operate on that data. It's quite common to pass in that initial data and store it in the object during its `__init__()` magic method. So you might theoretically have an object that stores information about employees:\n\n    class Employee:\n        def __init__(name, salary, favorite_food):\n            self.name = name\n            self.salary = salary\n            self.favorite_food = favorite_food\n        def  talk_about(self):\n            print(self.name + \" makes $\" + self.salary + \" per year and enjoys \" + self.favorite_food + \".\")\n\nYou could then create as many `Employee` records as you need, store them in a database, etc.:\n\n    pete = Employee(\"Pete Gonzales\", 55000, \"mushroom pizza\")\n    anna = Employee(\"Anna Smith\", 70000, \"tofu stir-fry\")\n    mohammed = Employee(\"Mohammed Baruk\", 64000, \"Philly cheese steaks\")\n\n... and you can use the methods of the object to operate on it:\n\n    >>> pete.talk_about()\n    Pete Gonzales makes 55000 per year and enjoys mushroom pizza.\n\nAs for the dots being used for methods as well as for instance data? Yes. Methods are also data; they're functions associated with an object (usually the object's *class*, rather than individual instances of an object). But functions, and therefore methods, are also data, because ... they're objects. Everything's an object in Python, including integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers, strings, lists, tuples, modules, class definitions, functions, methods ... they're all objects. A method is just a function object stored as an attribute on a class object. Instances \"inherit\" that reference (and other references) from their classes. (And the ancestors of their classes in an inheritance tree, but don't worry about that for now, you'll get to it later.)\n\nThe dot notation `a.b` just means \"look at object `a` and find its attribute `b`.\"  So `str.lower` means \"the `lower` method of the string class,\" and `'hello'.lower` means \"the `lower` method on the individual string `\"Hello\"`. Notice that neither of those examples *calls* the `.lower` method, because there's no parentheses after them; they just refer to the methods. Calling a function is an operation that happens when you follow its reference with parentheses.\n\nDoes that make sense?", "id": "ie35s4w", "parent": "t1_ie2pjw2", "vote": 1}, {"content": "You write some python to measure your data length.

Glad to be helpful.\n\n> Yes, for the most part I get it! Just a quick question, for the instance attributes, there is a LHS and a RHS. Eg:\n> \n> self.name = name\n> \n> First, this is not a 'method' even though it has the a.b notation, correct? its just the instance attribute.\n\nWell ... probably. You're likely right, and this is how instance data on objects works most commonly, and the attribute name, \"name\", tends to suggest it, but there's nothing that syntactically guarantees it. Python doesn't draw a bright line between functions and other types of data: functions are also data of a kind. They're callable data, data that does something when you invoke it by putting parentheses after it.\n\nSo this is a pretty standard way to set up an object:\n\n    class Thing:\n        def __init__(self, name, weight, width):\n            self.name = name\n            self.weight = weight\n            self.width = width\n\nIf you then create an instance by doing something like `pizza = Thing('vegetarian pizza', '1.5 lbs', '16 in')`, you have an instance of `Thing` that has a `.name`, `.weight`, and `.width` that you can access as `pizza.weight`, `pizza.name`, etc. But nothing in the code there enforces what type of data gets stored in those attributes: you could pass in a floating-point number, a list, a handle to an open file or a network socket, or anything else you want. Whether any of this is a *good idea* depends on what's going to be done with the data later, and that depends on the assumptions that are made in the rest of the code that that deals with the data, but the Python interpreter doesn't *enforce* any of this. It's up to you to write code that doesn't do nonsensical things, like adding a string and an integer. Sometimes -- a lot of the time -- that just means being cognizant of the assumptions the code is making: if other parts of the code assume that `.weight` is a weight in kilograms, and then goes ahead and performs arithmetic on it, then the code above will let you pass in the string `\"1.5 lbs\"` when initializing the instance, and will happily store the string `\"1.5 lbs\"` in the relevant attribute and not barf until it tries to do the math. And if you pass in a number, but it's measured in pounds or Troy ounces or multiples of the weight of an average car tire, the code won't know that, either, and your results will be off.\n\nFunctions are a kind of data too, and nothing prevents you from assigning a function as a class's or instance's attribute if you want to. Everything can be changed at runtime in Python. So if you've created that `pizza` object before, you can then do this:\n\n    def new_name(obj):\n        return \"Hello\"\n\n    pizza_name = new_name\n\nThis is maybe not as useful as might want it to be: the expression `pizza.name` doesn't automatically *run* the `new_name` function, it just *refers* to it. So if you then type `pizza.name` in the interactive prompt, you won't get the string \"Hello\"; you'll get a reference to the `new_name` function. If you were to type `new_name` at the prompt -- without the parentheses -- you'd have the interpreter answer you by saying something like `<function new_name at 0x7f5a1e00c4c0>`; typing `pizza.name` gives you approximately the same response. Typing `pizza.name()` *will* call the function, which is just another attribute stored in the object as the `.name` attribute; it's just that this particular attribute is a callable function instead of a string.\n\nWhich means that this is a very bad idea most of the time, of course; if you've got other code that expects to get a string back when it accesses the `.name` attribute of a `Thing` object, then that code will probably break if it gets a method back instead. But *the language itself doesn't prevent you from doing so*; you need to be cognizant of the assumptions that your code is making and be sure not to break them. It would (usually) be silly to reassign an attribute that usually carries a string so that it instead carries a function, but there are probably reasons why you might want to do that some of the time, and of course you can always write the code that deals with these objects in a way that can accommodate multiple types of data.\n\n(By the way, it's possible to set up `Thing.name` so that it runs code and returns a value instead of just looking up more-or-less static data stored on the instance; sometimes the compute-a-value-when-it's-referenced approach is the best approach for particular tasks. If you want to see some of the more abstract things you can do with Python, take a peek at how Python *properties* work; and if that's not abstract enough for you, look at *descriptors*, of which properties are a restricted example.)\n\nSo to answer your question: you can't be sure that `self.name` is just a bit of static data. Nothing prevents it from being a method. You can check its type, if you want, with `type(self.name)`, or check to see if it's a particular type with `isinstance(self.name, str)`, or you can check to see if it's callable by checking the return value of `callable(self.name)`, or any number of other things; but there's nothing in the syntax `self.name` that guarantees it's not a method. *You* can guarantee it's a data attribute by establishing that as a practice for your own code within a project, but the *language* doesn't make that promise for you. As someone or other once said, Python is a language for consenting adults.\n\n> For self.name=name , what is the proper terminology for 'name' on the LHS, vs the terminology for 'name' on the RHS?\n\nOn the left-hand side, you're talking about an instance attribute, which is the most specific thing you can say about it, given the context so far. If you need to be specific, you can always qualify it using the usual rules for how we say things specifically in English; so you could say something like \"self.name, which is always a string,\" if you needed to. You will occasionally see people talk about non-executable attributes as \"data attributes\" or \"static attributes,\" though both of those phrases can be confusing in some contexts: \"static\" means something specific in C and related languages that doesn't apply in Python, for instance, and using that term drags those associations along in the minds of many programmers.\n\nOn the right-hand side, all I can really say about the `name` expression without more context is that it's an expression, and that it must be a variable of some kind: perhaps a local variable, perhaps a global (well ... module-level) variable, perhaps a variable in a nested scope. If it occurs in the context of an initialization method, as in\n\n    class Thing:\n        def __init__(self, name):\n            self.name = name\n\n... then the `name` expression on the right side of the equals sign is a *parameter* of the `__init__` method.", "id": "ifeazlx", "parent": "t1_ifb1db5", "vote": 1}, {"content": "Thank you!", "id": "idx19os", "parent": "t1_idx180r", "vote": 1}], "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/vlhye3/ask_anything_monday_weekly_thread/", "question": {"context": "Welcome to another /r/learnPython weekly \"Ask Anything\\* Monday\" thread\n\nHere you can ask all the questions that you wanted to ask but didn't feel like making a new thread.\n\n\\* It's primarily intended for simple questions but as long as it's about python it's allowed.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or questions about this thread use the message the moderators button in the sidebar.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* Don't downvote stuff - instead explain what's wrong with the comment, if it's against the rules \"report\" it and it will be dealt with.\n* Don't post stuff that doesn't have absolutely anything to do with python.\n* Don't make fun of someone for not knowing something, insult anyone etc - this will result in an immediate ban.\n\nThat's it.", "id": "vlhye3", "title": "Ask Anything Monday - Weekly Thread"}, "resource": "Reddit"}, {"answers": [{"content": "It really does depend on what you want to do, but I'll give you a list of some of my personal favorites as well as the ones that I use a lot. (Includes standard library modules and stuff from PyPI)\n\n - `os`/`shutil` - The `os` and `shutil` modules are both built in, and they are super useful. The `os` module basically provides a bunch of interfaces to your operating system; you can get the name, environment variables, work with paths, and do stuff with files and directories. The `shutil` module is a bit smaller, as it just contains a bunch of high-level file operations, like recursive copying/removing, an implementation of the Unix `which` command, and an implementation of `chown`.\n\n - `re` - I might be a little bit insane, but I really like regular expressions. The `re` module allows you to work with regular expressions, and it can be super powerful. Regular expressions can be super confusing, but like everything, you learn over time. Useful tip: you can comment regular expressions in Python, which is really nice.\n\n - `flask` - This is the first module from PyPI. Flask is a backend web framework written in Python. If you are good at Python and want to do backend, Flask is super powerful and really good for beginners. Another thing, if you're working with bigger projects with big databases, you could also look at `django`, just its really just preference.\n\n - `configparser` - Going back to stuff in the standard library, we have `configparser`. ConfigParser allows you to read/write to `.ini` files, allowing you to easily save user preferences for your program. It's super easy to use so I like it a lot.\n\n - `decimal` - This one can be super helpful. Have you ever tried to do math in Python and it is almost correct but slightly off, causing hours of debugging with no avail? That's because of something called \"Floating Point Precision Errors,\" and it's in most programming languages. Because of the way that computers add numbers with binary, when you do arithmetic on floats, things tend to break. For example, open up the Python interpreter and try running `1.1 * 3`. You should get something like `3.3000000000000003`. The `decimal` module can allow you to fix this. After importing `Decimal` from the `decimal` module, try running `Decimal(\"1.1\") * Decimal(\"3\")` and see what happens, it should be the correct answer now.\n\n -  `requests` - `requests` is a module from PyPI, and it is incredibly helpful. `requests` allows you to, well, send HTTP requests for one thing. You could do this with the builtin `urllib` module, but requests has more features and is so much easier to use. \n\n - `argparse` - This one is built in, and it allows you to easily create command-line utilities. `argparse` will let you create different types of arguments, which can then be fed into your program to produce a result.\n\n - `PyQt5` - Interested in making GUIs but Tk isn't your favorite? Me too. I don't really create GUIs too often, but when I do, I like to use PyQt5. PyQt5 allows you to create Qt applications, and it is probably one of the most powerful GUI modules in Python. It comes with a ton of different widgets, and it's super easy to do stuff like multithreading with it. I personally like to use Qt Designer to create the GUIs, and then I use `pyuic5` to convert the `.ui` files to `PyQt5` code.\n\n - `colorama` - `colorama` allows you to easily add color to your command-line programs. Thats basically it.\n\n - `json` - The `json` module allows you to parse `json` into a Python dictionary, and then write a Python dictionary into JSON. Useful when paired with `requests` for getting API data, and just a useful module to know about in general.\n\n - `rich` - Rich allows you to create really nice looking console output, you can make errors look nice, render markdown, progress bars, and a ton of other stuff. It has support for 4-bit color, 8-bit color, Truecolor, and Dumb Terminals. I would really recommend checking it out.\n\n - `numpy` - NumPy is really good if you need to handle large amounts of data. NumPy also provides high-level mathematical functions to operate on these large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Since a lot of it is written in C, it is super fast, and the only downside really is that the arrays are stored completely in memory, so it's pretty easy to run out.\n\n**By popular demand:**\n\n - `itertools` - Itertools it's definitely an extremely useful module. It is used for creating iterators in a really easy way. For example, you can get all possible combinations of length `x` of two lists, get all the possible permutations of an iterable, and other really useful things. I should probably look more into this module myself.\n\nIn conclusion, there are a lot of different modules, and these are definitely not all of the useful ones, or even all of the ones that I use, but I figured that those are some nice modules to at least give you inspiration. You could also check out my GitHub for inspiration, if you wanted, and I have a few Python modules myself.

Have a quick browse and see what's there.\n\nThe most useful built-in ones, that are useful to nearly all aspects of Python, are `itertools` and `collections`. To some extent `functools` and `dataclasses` also, though they are not super useful immediately, but very useful to know about.\n\n- `itertools` provides advanced ways to combine, slice, flatten and group iterables and cycles. The `product()` function is very powerful, and can often replace nested for-loops in a compact way.\n- `functools` contains decorators that help you easily create classes that can be sorted, memoize functions, etc. There are many videos on how to utilize dataclasses and functools to create easy, maintainable, and powerful objects with ordering.\n- `collections` contains a plethora of useful utility tools. It has the `Counter` class, that can wrap an iterable and count the amount of each element, and return the top N most common items. It also provides `defaultdict`, which is a dictionary where unknown keys will have a specified default value. Saves you from writing code to check existence and initialize. Finally the `deque` object is a wrapper around a list, that supports lightning fast appends and pops, and the ability to rotate the lists.\n\nFor real-life scenarios, you'll quickly run into `requests` whenever you need to do interact with some website. It's a third-party plugin that builds on top of urllib, and removes the need for tons of boilerplate code. The `os` module will also be your way for interacting with the file system, together with `pathlib` and `glob` in some scenarios.", "id": "gyp808t", "parent": "t3_ng3nq0", "vote": 21}, {"content": "One thing I should have done sooner was learn to take advantage of python's built-in libraries, rather than implementing things myself because I didn't know about them. \n\nFor example, if you have a list of integers, and you want to obtain their counts, you could build something yourself, or just: \n\n    >>> import random\n    >>> from collections import Counter\n    >>>\n    >>> x = [random.randint(0, 10) for i in range(20)]\n    >>> x\n    [0, 4, 8, 10, 7, 5, 9, 10, 2, 6, 7, 2, 0, 10, 9, 1, 8, 10, 7, 0]\n    >>>\n    >>> counts = Counter(x)\n    >>> counts\n    Counter({10: 4, 0: 3, 7: 3, 8: 2, 9: 2, 2: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 1: 1})\n    >>> counts[0]\n    3\n    >>> counts[9]\n    2\n\nthe built-ins usually perform better than what I would have built, `itertools` is another good one, powerful stuff", "id": "gyq9og6", "parent": "t3_ng3nq0", "vote": 11}, {"content": "Like others have noted, it really depends on what you need to do.
